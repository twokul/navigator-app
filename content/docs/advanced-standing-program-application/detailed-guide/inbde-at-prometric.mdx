  The INBDE can be taken only in the U.S. and Canada and requires candidates to fly to these
  countries to take this exam.

The INBDE is a 2-day examination, and usually, the first day is a full day with
360 questions asked, and the second day of the test is a half-day with 140
questions asked.

Several Prometric centers offer this exam and can be chosen according to the
candidates' convenience.
