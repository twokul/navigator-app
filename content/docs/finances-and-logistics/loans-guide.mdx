title: Loans Guide
---

One of the first things I had to face after getting accepted into dental school
was the financial reality of it. These programs aren't cheap — tuition alone can
be over $80,000 a year, not including living expenses. And while I was lucky to
be a U.S. permanent resident by the time I applied, I know many others go
through this process as international students — and your loan options are very
different depending on your status.

## U.S. Citizen Or Green Card Holder

If you're a U.S. citizen or permanent resident (green card holder), you have
access to **federal student loans** — and that's a big deal.

### Federal Loans (through FAFSA)

You're eligible to apply for loans through the **Free Application for Federal
Student Aid (FAFSA)**. This includes:

- **Direct Unsubsidized Loans**:
  - Annual limit: $20,500
  - Fixed interest rate (usually lower than private loans)
  - No need for a co-signer
  - You're responsible for the interest, but it can be deferred while in school
- **Graduate PLUS Loans**:
  - Covers the **remaining cost of attendance** after other aid
  - Requires a basic credit check (not based on income or debt-to-income ratio)
  - Can borrow up to the **full cost of attendance** (tuition + living)

**Bonus:** These loans offer **income-driven repayment plans** and may qualify
for **Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF)** if you work in qualifying
settings later.

<Aside>
  Even if you don't think you'll get grants, fill out FAFSA — it's required for federal loans.
</Aside>

### Private Loans (Optional)

You can also apply for **private student loans** through banks or lenders like
Sallie Mae, Discover, or SoFi. These might offer lower rates (especially if you
have great credit), but:

- They're **not as flexible** in repayment
- They often **don't offer forbearance or forgiveness**
- Interest starts accumulating right away

## International Student (on F-1, H-4, etc.)

This is where things get trickier — because federal student loans are not
available to international students. But you still have some options.

### Private Loans with a U.S. Co-Signer

Many lenders (like **Sallie Mae**, **Earnest**, or **MPower Financing**) offer
**private education loans** to international students — **but most require a
co-signer** who:

- Is a **U.S. citizen or green card holder**
- Has **good credit history**
- Is willing to take legal responsibility for repaying the loan if you don't

This is the most common route students on an F-1 visa take — especially for
Advanced Standing Programs where scholarships are limited.

### No Co-Signer Loans (Limited Availability)

A few organizations and banks offer **loans without a U.S. co-signer**, but
they're:

- Less common
- Usually have **higher interest rates**
- Often limited to students attending specific schools

**Examples:**

- **MPower Financing** offers no-cosigner loans for certain graduate programs,
  including dentistry — but not all schools are eligible.
- **Prodigy Finance** is another lender that offers no-cosigner loans for
  international students, but again, only for certain programs.

### Timing Is Key

Most schools **advise international students not to apply for loans too early**
— because:

- Loan letters or pre-approvals **often expire within 30–60 days**
- You'll need them to be valid **when submitting visa-related financial proof**

For example: at USC, they recommend waiting until **April** to finalize your
private loan applications for a summer start date.

### What About Proof of Funds for I-20?

If you're on an F-1 visa, you’ll need to **show financial proof** to receive
your I-20. You can use:

- Savings or checking account statements (your own or family)
- Letters of financial support from sponsors
- Bank solvency letters
- Pre-approved **loan letters** (only if timed correctly)

Even if you plan to fund everything with a loan, you'll need to **submit valid
proof** — the amount is usually around **$80,000–$150,000 per year**, depending
on the program.

<Aside>Schools won't issue your I-20 until you meet their financial documentation standards.</Aside>

## Tips for Managing Loans Responsibly

Whether you're borrowing as a U.S. resident or an international student, here are
a few things I wish someone had emphasized early on:

- **Only borrow what you need** — especially for private loans with high
  interest
- **Understand the repayment timeline** (when interest starts, deferment rules)
- **Consider side income opportunities** during OPT or after graduation
- **Ask your school's financial aid office** for comparisons and guidance — they
  can help you explore school-specific grants or payment plans too

## Quick Comparison: Loan Options Based on Status

| Status            | Federal Loans | Private Loans (with Co-Signer) | Private Loans (No Co-Signer) |
| ----------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| U.S. Citizen      | ✅ Yes        | ✅ Yes                         | ✅ Optional                  |
| Green Card Holder | ✅ Yes        | ✅ Yes                         | ✅ Optional                  |
| F-1 Visa          | ❌ No         | ✅ Yes                         | ⚠️ Limited                   |
| H-4 Visa          | ❌ No         | ✅ Yes                         | ⚠️ Limited                   |

## Final Thoughts

Financing dental school is one of the biggest challenges — and your
**immigration status directly affects your options**. If you're a citizen or
green card holder, **use federal loans first** — they're safer and more
flexible. If you're an international student, know that **you can still get
loans**, but you’ll likely need a **co-signer** and solid planning around your
timeline.

I've met students who took out loans with sponsors, family help, savings, and
multiple lenders — it’s not easy, but it’s doable. Just make sure you understand
the long-term commitment and start gathering documents and researching options
as early as possible.
