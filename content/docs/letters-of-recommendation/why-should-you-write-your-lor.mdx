title: Why Should You Write Your Recommendation Letters?
---

Every dental school has its own requirements regarding recommendation letters,
so always check individual school policies. Usually most of the schools ask
letter from Dean, Professor and A Dentist you worked with. However, in general,
your letters should come from individuals who can speak to your academic
abilities, clinical experience, professionalism, and personal qualities.

Here are the best types of recommenders:

1. **A Dentist You Have Shadowed or Worked With**
   - They can describe your hands-on experience, work ethic, and ability to function in a professional dental setting.
   - Ideal for highlighting your **responsibility, patience, and interpersonal skills** with patients.
2. **Science Professors (Biology, Chemistry, Anatomy, etc.)**
   - Can speak about your **academic strengths, critical thinking, and problem-solving abilities.**
   - If youâ€™ve done research, an advisor or lab supervisor is a great choice to highlight your **research skills**.
3. **Employers or Supervisors from Healthcare or Volunteer Work**
   - If you worked in a health-related setting (nursing home, community clinic, public health initiative), this can demonstrate **your dedication to patient care and community service.**
   - Non-healthcare employers can still showcase **your professionalism, leadership, and teamwork.**
4. **Mentors or Supervisors from Extracurriculars & Leadership Roles**
   - If you led an organization, were involved in student government, or played a key role in a volunteer project, a mentor can highlight your **leadership and initiative.**
