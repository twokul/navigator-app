title: Scholarships & Financial Aid for Foreign-Trained Dentists
description: How International Dentists Can Find Scholarships and Funding for Advanced Standing Programs (ASPs)
---

When I first started exploring **Advanced Standing Programs (ASPs)** in the
U.S., I felt both **excited and overwhelmed**. The opportunities were incredible—but the
costs were **intimidating**. Tuition alone can range from **$100,000 to
$400,000**, not including living expenses, exams, and relocation costs.

As an **internationally trained dentist**, I quickly realized that funding
options for ASP students are **more limited** than for traditional DDS/DMD
students. Still, opportunities do exist—it just takes **persistence,
organization, and early research** to find them.
