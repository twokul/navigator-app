description: Why Choosing the Right Dental Schools Matters for International Applicants
---

For internationally trained dentists seeking Advanced Standing Programs (ASPs)
or pathways to licensure in the U.S., selecting the right dental schools is
critical. Admissions to these programs are highly competitive, and financial aid
opportunities are limited, making a strategic school selection essential. If
financial questions are of high priority for you, please read about funding
opportunities in [scholarships
rules](/c/finances-and-logistics/general-scholarship-rules).

Dental schools should be categorized into **three groups** to balance your
chances of admission.

- ðŸ”µ **Dream Schools** â€“ Highly prestigious universities with a low acceptance
  rate.
- ðŸŸ£ **Target Schools** â€“ Schools where your profile matches the average
  admitted student, giving you realistic chances of both admission and
  scholarships.
- ðŸŸ¢ **Safety Schools** â€“ Universities where your profile exceeds the admission
  requirements, ensuring a high probability of acceptance.

## How to Create a Balanced University List?

### Evaluate Your Profile

Consider your GPA, standardized test scores (TOEFL, INBDE, DAT),
extracurricular activities, and achievements.

### Research Admission Statistics

Check the university website for the average GPA, test score requirements, and acceptance rates.

### Categorize Universities Based on Your Profile

- If your profile is below average â†’ it's a **Dream School**
- If your profile matches or slightly exceeds requirements â†’ it's a **Target School**
- If your profile is significantly above average â†’ it's a **Safety School**

### Create a Strategic List

- **2â€“3 Dream Schools** (10â€“30% acceptance chance)
- **5â€“6 Target Schools** (40â€“70% acceptance chance)
- **2â€“3 Safety Schools** (80%+ acceptance chance)

### Keep Track of Deadlines and Applications

Use **ADEA** **CAAPID** website to manage the application deadlines efficiently.

Strategic university selection can greatly improve your chances of admission.
Plan wisely!

## Example

Here's how you can categorize dental schools and create a balanced list that
improves your chances of admission while optimizing scholarship opportunities.

### Three Categories of Schools for Dental ASP Applicants

#### ðŸ”µ Dream Schools (Highly Competitive, Low Acceptance Rate)

These are the top-tier dental schools with highly selective ASP programs. They
often accept **only 5-20 students per year** and have a large applicant pool,
making admission extremely competitive.

Profile fit:

- Extensive **clinical and research experience**
- Well-documented **U.S. dental experience** (shadowing, assisting, externships)
- Strong **recommendation letters from U.S. professionals**

Examples of dream schools for ASP applicants:

- **Harvard School of Dental Medicine (HSDM)** â€“ Prestigious, no scholarships
  for international students

  but highly competitive
- **Columbia University College of Dental Medicine** â€“ Prestigious, strong
  research focus
- **University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA)** â€“ High standards, well-funded
  school

</Aside>

#### ðŸŸ£ Target Schools (Moderate Acceptance Rate)

These are **high-quality schools where your profile matches or slightly
exceeds** the admitted students' average profile.

Profile fit:

- Good **TOEFL and GPA; INBDE,**

  programs](/c/researching-schools/externship-programs) where participation may
  **improve scholarship eligibility**.

</Aside>

#### ðŸŸ¢ Safety Schools (Higher Acceptance Rate, Scholarship Potential)

These are programs where your profile **exceeds the average accepted student**,
ensuring a high chance of acceptance.

Profile fit:

- Strong **INBDE, TOEFL, and GPA** (above the average admitted student)

  good clinical program
- **University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) College of Dentistry** â€“ ASP program
  with good clinical exposure
