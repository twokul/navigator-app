title: Minnesota Path To Licensure
description: How foreign-trained dentists can obtain a dental license in Minnesota without additional U.S. training
---

Minnesota is **the only U.S. state** that allows qualified dentists from
**non-accredited international dental schools** to obtain a license **without
completing additional U.S. training**.

In 2008, the [Minnesota Board of Dentistry](states.minnesota.limitedGeneral) established a special licensure pathway for these applicants. To qualify, candidates must meet specific requirements and pass certain exams, including:

- **INBDE (Integrated National Board Dental Examination)**
- **TOEFL (Test of English as a Foreign Language)**

These scores are part of the initial application process.

### Application Process

The Board's **Credentials Committee** reviews applications approximately every six weeks on a **first-come, first-served** basis. During this review, the Committee may:

- Request an **interview** with the applicant
- Ask for **patient records** or additional documentation
- Evaluate whether the applicantâ€™s dental education is **equivalent to a U.S. dental program**

If the Committee determines the applicant's education meets U.S. standards, the
candidate may proceed to:

1. **Minnesota Bench Exam**
2. A **Board-approved clinical licensing exam**

---

### Limited General License

Dentists approved through this pathway are granted a **Limited General Dental License**.  
Under this license, they must:

- **Work under the supervision** of a licensed Minnesota dentist for **three years**
- Accept possible **restrictions** on the scope of dental services they can provide

After successfully completing the three-year period, they become eligible for an
**Unrestricted General Dental License** in Minnesota.
