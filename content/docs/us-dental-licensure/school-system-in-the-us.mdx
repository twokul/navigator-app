## Overview

As I mentioned before every candidate seeking a license to practice dentistry
needs to fulfill three basic requirements which include having a diploma from a
CODA accredited dental school and passing theoretical and practical exams. To
understand the process for foreign-trained dentists, let's first look at **HOW
BECOMING A DENTIST IS NORMALLY DONE IN THE U.S.**

First, students finish high school (11th and 12th grades) and go to a college
(undergraduate degree) where they need to complete 4 years of pre-dental courses
(with subjects like biology, chemistry, physics, etc.) to prepare for the next
step - admission to a dental school (graduate school). They take the DAT
([Dental Admission Test](https://www.ada.org/education/testing/exams/dental-admission-test-dat)), overseen by the American Dental Association (ADA).
This exam includes 280 questions on natural sciences, reading comprehension, and
quantitative reasoning.

During the admissions process, dental schools evaluate DAT scores, GPAs,
interviews, and letters of recommendation. Dental school usually lasts 4 years
(there are one or two programs with 3-year programs) divided into 2 years of
pre-clinical studies and 2 years of clinical training. After finishing a dental
school they receive a degree, either DMD (Doctor of Dental Medicine) or DDS
(Doctor of Dental Surgery).

Both degrees are equivalent, and there's no difference other than the name. With
DMD or DDS graduates take a regional licensing exam to qualify for state dental
licenses and can work as general dentists.

Unlike some countries, there's no mandatory 1-year clinical internship. For
additional training in General Dentistry, programs like GPR (General Practice
Residency) or AEGD (Advanced Education in General Dentistry) are available.
There are also various post-doctoral/specialty programs in 11 different branches
of Dentistry for those seeking further education. Specialties that are
officially recognized by the CODA (Commission on Dental Accreditation) and ADA:
Dental Anesthesiology, Dental Public Health, Endodontics, Oral and Maxillofacial
Pathology, Oral and Maxillofacial Radiology, Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery,
Oral Medicine, Orofacial Pain, Orthodontics and Dentofacial Orthopedics,
Pediatric Dentistry, Periodontics, and Prosthodontics. More information about
these advanced education options can be found [here](https://coda.ada.org/find-a-program).

  Note that general dentists can perform any procedure, even those done by specialists. But
  insurance companies pay general dentists less than specialists for the same procedures.

## Exams

During dental school, students take many exams, both theoretical and practical.
The most important are passing the [Integrated National Board Dental Examination
(INBDE)](https://jcnde.ada.org/inbde?_gl=1*t6u7f8*_ga*Njk1MDgxNjA0LjE3MDM2NTU3MDM.*_ga_X8X57NRJ4D*MTcwMzgzMTg3OC42LjEuMTcwMzgzMTk2My4wLjAuMA..)
and a practical (regional) exam (the regional board). There are 5 versions of
the practical exam, each of which is designed to test the practical abilities of
dental students in real-world scenarios. These exams are accepted by different
states, so dental students need to choose the exam that aligns with the
licensure requirements of the state where they plan to practice.

The key regional exams include:

1. **Central Regional Dental Testing Service (CRDTS)**: This exam evaluates
   candidates on their clinical skills in various dental procedures.
2. **Council of Interstate Testing Agencies, Inc. (CITA)**: CITA conducts exams
   that focus on both clinical skills and knowledge of dental theory.
3. **Commission on Dental Competency Assessments (CDCA)**: Formerly known as the
   North East Regional Board of Dental Examiners, Inc. (NERB), the CDCA administers
   a widely recognized clinical exam.
4. **Southern Regional Testing Agency (SRTA)**: This exam tests clinical
   competencies in a range of dental treatments.
5. **Western Regional Examining Board (WREB)**: WREB's exams are accepted in
   many western states and cover comprehensive clinical dental skills.

Each of these practical exams is accepted by a certain number of states
(regions). The most common is the 3rd option - CDCA. Also, while in dental
school, a student needs to meet practical requirements for licensure, like a
certain number of fillings, prostheses, root canals, crowns, etc.

With a diploma (DMD or DDS), passed INBDE (theory) and CDCA (practice), a
student can get an initial license in most states in the USA. To learn more

Now let’s look at the process for the international (foreign-trained) dentists.
