Financing a U.S. education as an international student may seem daunting, but
scholarships, assistantships, and university financial aid can make it possible
â€” if you know where to look and how to apply.

### Universities Scholarships/ Financial Aid

Some U.S. schools offer substantial aid to international students.

- If your ASP program is at a **private university** (like USC, NYU, BU, etc.), **you may be eligible for merit-based scholarships or departmental awards**, even as an international student.
- **Need-based aid is less common** for ASP students but still possible at some schools if you're classified as a degree-seeking student.

Check the schoolâ€™s admissions/financial aid page and search for:

- "Scholarships for international students"
- "Need-based aid"
- "Merit scholarships"

### Assistantships for Graduate Students

1. **Teaching Assistantships (TAs)**: Help with courses and grading.
2. **Research Assistantships (RAs)**: Work on faculty research projects.
3. **Administrative Assistantships**: Work in student affairs, admissions, etc.

ðŸ’¡ These positions may include a tuition waiver or stipend. Though they are r**are in ASP programs** due to the clinical nature and time demands, but occasionally available through public health or research departments if youâ€™re doing a dual degree or elective research. Contact the department or university to check availability for international students.

### Important Limitations for ASP Students

- **Federal Aid (FAFSA)**: Not available to international students. You can only apply if you're a U.S. citizen or permanent resident.
- **State or public university aid**: Often limited to residents or citizens, though you can still ask each school about exceptions.
- **Military/Service-based scholarships**: Typically require U.S. citizenship or green card holders (e.g., HPSP, HSCP).

### Types of Scholarships You Can Apply For

- **Need-Based Scholarships**: Based on your familyâ€™s financial situation. Often used to fill the gap between tuition and what you can afford.
- **Merit-Based Scholarships**: Based on your achievements â€” academic, extracurricular, sports, or community work.
- **Athletic Scholarships**: Offered to student-athletes by the collegeâ€™s athletic department.
- **Country-Specific or Minority-Based Scholarships**: Offered to students from specific regions or backgrounds.
- **Privately-Funded Scholarships**: Provided by organizations, donors, or businesses â€” often for students from developing countries or specific fields.
- **Partial Scholarships**: One-time or annual awards, usually $1,000â€“$5,000.
- **Government or International Organization Scholarships**: From your home country or large orgs like Fulbright or World Bank (typically for graduate studies).

### Ways to Finance Your U.S. Education

**Scholarships from Universities**

Don't be discouraged by the high cost of U.S. education. About 85% of students in U.S. universities receive some form of financial aid. Here are the main types of scholarships offered by U.S. universities:

#### Need-based Scholarships

- Available for undergraduate and graduate levels.
- Based on financial need. Some universities cover the remaining tuition if students can demonstrate financial need and lack of other financial means. This type of scholarship can potentially cover the entire cost of your tuition.
- Financial need is typically calculated as: [Cost of Attendance] â€“ [Expected Family Contribution] = [Student Need]

#### Merit-based Scholarships

- Available for undergraduate and graduate levels.
- For students with impressive academic achievements. This includes participation in competitions, extracurricular activities, sports, or exceptional community or entrepreneurial work. Any achievement that makes you stand out.

#### Athletic Scholarships

- Available for undergraduate levels.
- Awarded to student-athletes by the college athletic department based on their athletic abilities and contribution to the team. Coaches decide on recipients and the scholarship amounts, which can range from a small yearly tuition percentage to a full scholarship covering all costs.
- This is not an option for us since we apply for a graduate level aid.

### How to Search for University Scholarships

When searching for university scholarships, visit the website of each university you're interested in. They often list all scholarships available to international students. Always check for:

- **How much money the school offers to international students:** U.S. universities usually indicate the amount of financial aid available and the maximum amount you can expect. If this information isn't on the website, email the admission or financial aid committee to ask. Don't hesitate to inquire about the financial aid available to international students.
- **Scholarship application requirements:** Determine if you need to submit an additional application for scholarships or if you will be considered automatically. Missing an additional application can cost you your chance at financial aid.

Pay attention to these terms on university websites:

- "Financial Aid"
- "Scholarships"
- "Need-based scholarships/aid"
- "Merit-based scholarships/admissions"
- "Scholarships for international students"
- "Admissions & Aid"
- "Tuition Assistance"

### Assistantships at Universities

### Teaching Assistantships

Graduate students can receive payment for working at the university, which can help cover tuition or living expenses. These positions often involve conducting small classes, delivering lectures, correcting coursework, grading papers, counseling students, or supervising lab groups. If interested, contact the academic department of the university you apply to.

### Research Assistantships

Graduate students can also get research assistantships, assisting in the research activities of a faculty member. If interested, contact the department or the specific professor conducting the research.

### Administrative Assistantships

These positions are not necessarily related to your academic area and involve working in administrative offices like admissions, student affairs, residence life, or the library. These assistantships can supplement living expenses or cover a portion of your tuition.

Check university websites to see if they offer these opportunities for international students.

Here is an example from University of South Florida:

### Other Scholarships

- For **external scholarships**, search 2â€“3 hours weekly and apply early â€” often 8â€“9 months before the academic year starts.
- Make sure the scholarship is **legitimate**. If unsure, email them directly.

#### Country-based Scholarships

These scholarships target students from developing countries. Look for scholarships offered specifically to students from your home country by searching for "scholarships for students from [your country]".

#### Government-funded Scholarships

The U.S. government offers many scholarships for international students. Also, check for government-funded scholarships from your own country. Your government may have programs to sponsor foreign education that you're not aware of.

#### Privately-funded Scholarships (Minority Organizations)

Private businesses or donors sometimes fund scholarships for international students, often targeting developing countries, minority groups, or specific fields of study. Research organizations that support international students with your cultural, religious, or ethnic background.

#### International Organizations

Large international organizations, like certain branches of the United Nations, the Organization of American States, and the World Bank, offer funding for international students. These scholarships are highly competitive and usually for graduate students.

#### Partial Scholarships

These range from small one-time payments to larger amounts that cover certain university costs. Typically awarded through competitions, these scholarships can provide between $1,000 to $5,000, supplementing your education expenses.

#### Student Loans

International students can apply for private student loans, often requiring a U.S. cosigner. A cosigner is responsible for repaying the loan if you don't fulfill your obligations.
