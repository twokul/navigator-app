title: Final Tips for a Strong LOR Strategy
---

Strong recommendation letters can set you apart in the competitive dental school
admissions process. By choosing the right recommenders, guiding them with
helpful materials, and ensuring timely submissions, you can secure letters that
enhance your application and increase your chances of acceptance.

## Pick recommenders who know you well

A detailed, personalized letter is better than a generic one from a high-profile individual.

## Ensure variety

Each letter should highlight **different skills, qualities, and experiences** to create a full picture.

## Make sure the letters are well-written

They should be structured, clear, and **specific with examples** rather than just general praise.

## Follow school-specific requirements

Some schools have **specific LOR requirements**, such as needing a dentist's letter or a professor's/dean's letter.

By carefully choosing recommenders and making sure each LOR highlights a
**different** aspect of your candidacy, you'll present yourself as a
**well-rounded, strong applicant** who is ready for the challenges of dental
school.
