If you're a foreign-trained dentist looking to gain hands-on experience, enhance
your clinical skills, or strengthen your application for an Advanced Standing
Program (ASP) or residency in the U.S., a Postdoctoral Externship Program might
be a great option. These programs provide international dentists with
short-term, supervised clinical exposure in U.S. dental schools or hospitals,
helping them understand American dentistry standards while building valuable
professional connections.

## What is a Postdoctoral Externship Program?

A **Postdoctoral Externship** is a **non-degree, short-term clinical training
program** designed for internationally trained dentists. These programs
typically last from **a few weeks to several months** and allow participants to:

- Observe and assist in **advanced clinical cases**
- Work alongside **faculty, residents, and dental students**
- Gain exposure to **specialized fields like prosthodontics, periodontics, and oral surgery**
- Learn about **U.S. dental protocols, regulations, and patient management**
- Strengthen applications for **residency or Advanced Standing Programs**

Unlike formal **residency programs**, externships do not lead to licensure or
board certification but serve as a **stepping stone for further education or
training in the U.S.**

## Who is Eligible for a Postdoctoral Externship?

Most programs require applicants to:

- Have a **BDS, DDS, or equivalent foreign dental degree**
- Meet **English language proficiency** requirements (TOEFL may be required)
- Submit **letters of recommendation & CV**
- Provide **proof of clinical experience or prior education**
- Hold a valid **visa (usually a visitor or student visa, depending on the program)**

Some programs also **require applicants to pass INBDE** or have prior U.S.
dental experience (shadowing, observerships, etc.), while others accept
beginners looking for their **first clinical exposure in the U.S.**.

## Why Consider a Postdoctoral Externship?

If you're planning to apply for an **Advanced Standing Program (ASP) or a dental
residency**, a postdoctoral externship can significantly **boost your profile**
by:

- **Providing U.S. Clinical Experience** – A major advantage for ASP applications
- **Helping with Letters of Recommendation** – Faculty connections can lead to strong recommendations
- **Enhancing Hands-On Skills** – Exposure to U.S. dental technology and treatment approaches
- **Building a Professional Network** – Meeting faculty, specialists, and fellow applicants
- **Understanding U.S. Dental Systems** – Learning about insurance, patient care, and ethical standards

  If your goal is to enter a competitive program, an externship at a well-known dental school can
  improve your chances by giving you direct experience and faculty endorsements.
