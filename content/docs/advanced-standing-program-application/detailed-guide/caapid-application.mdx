# CAAPID Application Timeline

The CAAPID application cycle typically runs **from March to February**, but
individual schools may have different deadlines and requirements. By now, you
should already have a list of the schools you plan to apply to. If not, explore
participating programs using the official [CAAPID Program
Finder](official.caapidProgramFinder).

A few schools **do not** use CAAPID and require direct applications, but most
universities offering Advanced Standing programs accept applications through the
CAAPID portal.

## Before Starting Your Application

Before the new application cycle opens in **March**, you can create a CAAPID
account to explore the system and prepare your materials. The official
[Application Instructions](official.adea.caapidApplicantHelpCenter) include a
detailed, step-by-step guide for each section to help you get ready in advance.

It’s **strongly recommended** to review these instructions before the cycle opens to avoid last-minute issues.

However, **do not begin filling out** your application until the new cycle
starts — information entered early **will not transfer** to the new cycle, and
you would have to re-enter it.

Use this time instead to **familiarize yourself with the system** and **gather
all required documents** ahead of time.
