Below I'd like to give you a comparison of the two paths – advanced standing
programs and residency – for foreign-trained dentists in the U.S. to help you
make the right choices. Here are the key pros and cons of each.

## Advanced Standing Programs

| Pros                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Cons                                                                                                                                                        |

| **Path to Licensure**: Completing an advanced standing program typically leads directly to eligibility for dental licensure in the U.S., making it a straightforward path to practice dentistry in any state. | **Duration and Cost**: These programs usually span 2-3 years and can be costly, representing a significant time and financial commitment.                   |
| **Comprehensive Education**: These programs cover all aspects of dental education, providing a well-rounded understanding and skill set that align with U.S. standards.                                       | **Competitive Admission**: Admission to these programs is competitive, requiring a strong academic record and often additional examinations or credentials. |
| **Familiarity with U.S. Dental Practices**: Graduates become fully acquainted with the dental practices, protocols, and patient interaction styles prevalent in the U.S.                                      | **General Focus**: Advanced standing programs don't specialize in a specific area of dentistry, which might be a drawback if you're looking to specialize.  |

## Residency Programs

| Pros                                                                                                                                                                     | Cons                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Specialization**: Residency programs offer specialized training in a particular area of dentistry, which is ideal if you have a clear specialty interest.              | **Licensure Varies by State**: Not all states recognize residency programs as a path to licensure for foreign-trained dentists. You may need to research state-specific requirements. |
| **Clinical Experience**: These programs provide intense clinical experience, often in a hospital setting, which is invaluable for certain specialties.                   | **Highly Competitive**: Gaining admission into a residency program can be highly competitive, with limited spots and rigorous selection criteria.                                     |
| **Research and Academic Opportunities**: Many residency programs offer opportunities for research and academic pursuits, which can be beneficial for career advancement. | **Length of Training**: Depending on the specialty, residency programs can be lengthy, sometimes requiring several years of training.                                                 |

<Aside>

If your goal is to practice general dentistry in the U.S. as soon as possible
and in any state in the country, an advanced standing program may be the most
direct and suitable path.

If you are interested in specializing and are open to the possibility that you
might need additional steps for licensure depending on the state, a residency
program might be a better fit.
