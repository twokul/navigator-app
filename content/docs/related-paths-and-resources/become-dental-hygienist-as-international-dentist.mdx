title: Become a Dental Hygienist As International Dentist
description: How to Become a Licensed Dental Hygienist in the U.S. as an International Dentist
---

If you want to become a Dental Hygienist not as part of your Advanced Standing
program application but as a solid career opportunity, here is what you need to
know.

For internationally trained dentists, the U.S. licensure journey can be long,
expensive, and uncertain. While many pursue DDS or DMD degrees through Advanced
Standing Programs (ASPs), another valuable and often overlooked path is becoming
a **licensed dental hygienist**.

This path offers a **shorter, more affordable entry into clinical practice**,
legal income opportunities, and the chance to **build U.S. dental
experience**—all while strengthening your profile if you still plan to apply to
dental school later.

With growing workforce shortages and recent legislative changes, several states
are making it easier for foreign-trained dentists to become licensed hygienists
**without completing a U.S.-based dental hygiene program**. This guide breaks
down the most accessible options, requirements, and strategic steps.

## General Requirements

Traditionally, to practice as a dental hygienist in the U.S., one must:

- **Graduate from an Accredited U.S. Dental Hygiene Program:** This involves
  completing a program accredited by the American Dental Association's Commission
  on Dental Accreditation (CODA). Here is the [link](https://coda.ada.org/find-a-program/search-dental-programs#sort=%40codastatecitysort%20ascending)
- **Pass the National Board Dental Hygiene Examination (NBDHE):** A written exam
  assessing knowledge pertinent to dental hygiene practice. Here is the

- **Complete a Clinical Examination:** Successfully pass a state or regional
  clinical board
  examination.[Home+4ADHA+4ADHA+4](https://www.adha.org/education-resources/become-a-dental-hygienist/dental-hygiene-programs/professional-roles-of-an-rdh/internationally-trained-hygienists/)

For internationally trained dentists, these requirements often necessitate
additional education and credential evaluations. Detailed information is

## Why Consider the Dental Hygiene Path?

For many foreign-trained dentists, becoming a hygienist in the U.S. is not a step down—it's a **strategic move**. Here’s why:

- ✅ **Legal clinical experience** in the U.S.
- ✅ Boosts your **CV and dental school applications**
- ✅ Opportunity to **earn income** while waiting for interviews or exams
- ✅ Builds **professional network** and familiarity with U.S. dental systems
- ✅ May lead to **licensure in multiple states** after gaining experience
- ✅ Suitable for dentists who want a more **flexible, lower-debt, or lifestyle-focused career**

_Many ASP applicants pursue this route to show long-term commitment to dentistry in the U.S. while gaining valuable real-world experience._

## States Where You Can Practice Without a U.S. Dental Hygiene Degree

### Florida – Most Accessible and Strategic Option

Florida is currently the **only state** that allows foreign-trained dentists to become licensed dental hygienists **without completing a U.S.-based dental hygiene program**. It's also the most commonly chosen route for ASP applicants and foreign dentists seeking fast, legal entry into the dental workforce.

#### Requirements

- Proof of **foreign dental degree**
- **INBDE (Integrated National Board Dental Exam)** passed (or NBDHE if you don’t have INBDE yet)
- **CPR/BLS certification**
- **Background check** and fingerprinting
- Passing:
  - **Florida Laws & Rules Exam**
  - **ADEX Clinical Dental Hygiene Exam**
- Official Application: [Florida Dental Hygiene Application PDF](https://floridasdentistry.gov/Applications/dental-hygiene-app.pdf)
- ADEX Exam Info: [CDCA Exams Website](https://www.cdcaexams.org/)

#### Why This Route Is Popular

- Enables you to **practice legally and earn income**
- Demonstrates **U.S. commitment and experience** to dental schools
- After one year of practice, opens doors to **reciprocity or simplified pathways in other states** like Arizona and Missouri

#### How to Work It Out

If you've passed the INBDE, you can:

1. Get a credential evaluation of your dental degree (ECE or WES)
2. Apply for licensure in Florida
3. Register for and pass the required exams (ADEX + Laws/Rules)
4. Obtain CPR certification and complete background checks
5. Receive your license and begin work

### Arizona & Missouri – Reciprocity After Florida Experience

After **one year of clinical practice in Florida**, foreign-trained dentists may qualify for licensure in:

- **Arizona**
- **Missouri** (based on newly passed laws—limited implementation cases)

These states have started accepting foreign-trained dentists with Florida hygiene licenses, recognizing their **U.S. clinical experience and passed board exams**.

<Aside>
  These pathways are still new. Requirements like state-specific jurisprudence exams or additional
  documentation may apply. Always verify with the state dental board.
</Aside>

### Massachusetts – New Law (Effective Dec 31, 2024)

Massachusetts passed a law enabling foreign-trained dentists to apply for a dental hygiene license **without a U.S.-based degree**, beginning **Dec 31, 2024**.

#### Requirements

- Valid **foreign dental license**
- At least **5 years of clinical practice** abroad
- **CPR/BLS certification**
- **Massachusetts Jurisprudence & Ethics Exam**
- **Criminal background check (CORI)**
- Transcripts + full application to the **Board of Registration in Dentistry**

<Aside>
  As of now, regulations are still being finalized—no licenses under this law will be issued until
  that process is complete.
</Aside>

### States to Watch – Legislation in Progress

#### Connecticut

Currently allows some foreign-trained dentists to apply for licensure if they’ve completed **clinical training within a CODA-accredited hygiene program in the state**. A **new bill (SB 841)** is being considered to expand access.

- [Track SB 841 on BillTrack50](https://www.billtrack50.com/billdetail/1791303)

#### California, New York, Texas, Washington

Not currently allowing direct licensure for foreign dentists, but **advocacy
efforts and workforce shortages** may prompt future legislative updates.

<Aside>
  These pathways are still new. Requirements like state-specific jurisprudence exams or additional
  documentation may apply. Always verify with the state dental board.
</Aside>

## U.S. Options That Require Completing a Dental Hygiene Degree

If you’re applying in a state that does _not_ accept your foreign dental degree, you’ll need to complete a **U.S.-based CODA-accredited hygiene program**.

#### Option 1: NYU Advanced Standing Program (For Dentists)

- Duration: 12 months
- Cost: ~$130,000
- Targeted specifically at foreign-trained dentists
- Degree accepted in all 50 states
- [NYU Program Details](https://dental.nyu.edu/education/dental-hygiene-programs/degree-programs/advanced-standing.html)

## Summary

If you're an internationally trained dentist aiming to practice in the U.S., becoming a licensed dental hygienist is a **legitimate, respected, and increasingly flexible path**. It offers faster clinical entry, professional growth, and even a stepping stone toward DDS admission.

Whether you:

- Use Florida as a launchpad,
- Apply under new laws in Massachusetts or Connecticut, or
- Enroll in a 12-month advanced hygiene program,

—you have **more options than ever before** to legally practice, contribute to patient care, and shape your future in U.S. dentistry.

**Considerations and Recommendations:**

- **State Variability:** Licensing requirements differ by state. It's essential to consult the specific dental board of the state where you intend to practice. A comprehensive list of state dental boards is available through the https://www.ada.org/resources/careers/licensure/state-dental-boards
- **Stay Updated:** Legislation and policies are evolving. Regularly review updates from professional associations like the ADA and ADHA to stay informed about changes that may impact licensure pathways.
- **Credential Evaluation:** Engage with recognized credential evaluation services to assess the equivalency of your foreign dental education. This evaluation is often a prerequisite for further education or licensure applications. https://www.ece.org/
- **Professional Networking:** Connect with professional organizations and peers to gain insights and guidance tailored to your situation. Networking can provide valuable support as you navigate the licensure process

## Bonus Tips for those applying to ASP programs to earn DDS.

- **Dental experience in the U.S.** (as a volunteer, assistant, or technician) adds value to your CV, especially if you plan to pursue further education later.
- Look for **dental startups**—even non-clinical roles (e.g., education, content, tech) help demonstrate U.S. experience and versatility.
- **Network proactively**. Reach out to students and professionals in schools you're interested in. Ask for help, advice, or introductions to volunteer opportunities.
- Prioritize schools/states where you're more likely to secure opportunities or licensure quickly.
