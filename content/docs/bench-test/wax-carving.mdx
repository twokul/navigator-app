title: Wax Carving
description: Wax carving for the bench test
---

The wax carving procedure in dental bench tests is designed to assess the manual
dexterity, precision, and understanding of dental anatomy of the candidates.
During the wax carving procedure in dental bench tests, schools typically
provide a tooth model or detailed diagrams to replicate the anatomy from. This
model serves as a reference for candidates to ensure they accurately replicate
the anatomical features of the assigned tooth. Here is a detailed description of
what the wax carving procedure typically entails and what schools provide for it.

### Detailed Procedure of Wax Carving

#### Preparation

- Candidates are given a block of dental wax and the necessary carving
  instruments (sometimes provided by the school, but not always the case and you
  need to bring your carvers).
- The test environment usually includes dental tools like waxing instruments,
  carving knives, and sometimes a Bunsen burner to soften the wax. (depends on the
  school)

#### Assignment

- Candidates are typically assigned to carve a specific tooth or set of teeth.
  This can range from a single tooth like a molar or incisor to multiple teeth
  structures. (crown and root). Sometimes students can be assigned to carve a
  particular shape like a triangle, square and oval, or all of them at once on top
  of each other. Some schools asked to carve an old school telephone handle. etc.
- The tooth assignment usually includes instructions on the morphology that
  needs to be replicated. Some schools provide only the picture of the tooth and
  its number.
- It's important to know the teeth measurements for the carving. For that you
  can use the [PDF WHeeler's Anatomy](/files/wheeler-dental-anatomy.pdf).
- Other books you can use:
  - [Permanent Teeth ](https://www.anatomystandard.com/ossa-et-juncturae/cranium/dentes-permanentes.html)
  - [Concise Dental Anatomy and Morphology](https://www.academia.edu/21433489/Concise_Dental_Anatomy_and_Morphology)

#### Carving Process

- **Initial Shaping**: shape the wax block into the rough outline of the
  assigned tooth.
- **Detailed Carving**: Using fine tools, carve the detailed anatomy of the
  tooth, including cusps, ridges, and grooves.
- **Refinement**: smooth the surfaces and ensure the proportions are accurate,
  checking against models or diagrams provided.
- **Final Touches**: add additional fine details, and the tooth is polished to a
  realistic finish.

#### Evaluation Criteria

- Accuracy in replicating the anatomical features of the tooth.
- Precision in carving fine details.
- Overall aesthetic and finish of the carved tooth.
- Time management and ability to complete the task within the given timeframe.

### Videos For Self Study

Practice your carving skills.

Before you start carving teeth from wax I suggest you to thoroughly learn the
anatomy of each tooth to understand the important features of each tooth that
you need to represent through carving. For that you can refer to the Wheelerâ€™s
Anatomy book that I already mentioned earlier, or here's another great resource
a video from Christopher W Stokes to help you:

After you familiarized yourself with anatomy and morphology, it's time to
practice. Here are a few great resources to study from but you are welcome to
search for other videos that you find helpful.

It's a compiled resource of past bench test experiences, including
school-specific requirements, prep guidelines, candidate insights, and useful
study materials. This database provides valuable information to help applicants
understand expectations and prepare effectively.
