title: Become a Dental Hygienist as ASP Applicant
description: Why Many Advanced Standing Applicants Choose Florida Dental Hygiene Licensure
---

For internationally trained dentists navigating the complex and competitive
process of applying to U.S. Advanced Standing Programs (ASPs), standing out as a
strong candidate is key. One strategic and increasingly popular option is
obtaining a **Florida dental hygienist license**. Unlike most states, Florida
allows foreign-trained dentists to become licensed dental hygienists **without
completing a U.S.-based hygiene program**, provided they meet specific
requirements.

This pathway not only offers a legal opportunity to **practice clinically in the
U.S.**, but also demonstrates your **commitment to dentistry**, **adaptability
to the U.S. healthcare system**, and provides a way to gain **hands-on local
experience** — all of which strengthen your ASP application.

### Why This Path Makes Sense for DDS Applicants

Here’s why many international dentists take the Florida route before or during their application to dental schools:

- ✅ **Clinical U.S. Experience**: Schools highly value local clinical experience. Working legally as a hygienist helps you understand patient management, communication, and infection control standards in the U.S.
- ✅ **Income During the Application Period**: While waiting for interviews or decisions, you can earn income in a licensed clinical role.
- ✅ **Demonstrates Long-Term Commitment**: Admissions committees appreciate applicants who take proactive steps to integrate into the dental workforce, not just study for exams.
- ✅ **Networking**: Working in U.S. dental offices as a hygienist allows you to build relationships, find mentors, and even secure stronger recommendation letters from local professionals.
- ✅ **Licensure Mobility**: After one year of licensed practice in Florida, you may qualify to apply for licensure in **Arizona** or **Missouri** without additional education.
