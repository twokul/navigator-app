title: Step 2. Find Required Documentation and Order ECE Evaluation Reports
description: Learn how to prepare and submit your educational documents for an official ECE Course-by-Course Evaluation — a key step to becoming eligible for the INBDE exam.

<Aside>
  As you already know, one of the main requirements for applying to an Advanced Standing Program—or
  any ADA-accredited dental school—is passing the INBDE. To schedule and take the INBDE, you must
  complete several preparatory steps, including evaluating your credentials and obtaining your
  unique dental ID number (DENTPIN), which we’ll discuss in the next step.
</Aside>

A **credential evaluation** compares academic and professional degrees earned
abroad to their U.S. equivalents. Dental schools use these evaluations to assess
foreign education based on U.S. academic standards.

Most dental schools require applicants to submit an evaluation from **[ECE
(Educational Credential Evaluators)](official.eceHome)**. However, some
schools accept only **[WES (World Education Services)](official.wes)**
reports. To confirm which one you need, check your **Research Spreadsheet** and
review each school’s requirements.

To register for and take the INBDE, you must have a **course-by-course
evaluation** from ECE. Some schools may also require a WES report during the
admissions process—so if your target schools accept only WES, you’ll need to
order that evaluation as well.

## ECE Evaluation

Since the majority of dental schools accept ECE evaluations, we'll focus on that process here.  
WES follows a similar, straightforward procedure, which you can find on their website.

**Educational Credential Evaluators (ECE)** is a non-profit organization that
determines the U.S. equivalency of educational qualifications earned in other
countries.

The **ECE Course-by-Course Evaluation** costs **$195 (as of 2024)**. Fees may
vary depending on the number of report copies you request.

## How to Order Your ECE Evaluation

Follow these steps carefully:

1. **Visit the [ECE website](official.eceUSInstitutions).**
2. Select **“Course-by-Course Evaluation.”**
3. Review the **[documentation requirements](official.eceDocumentationRequirements)** for your country.
   - Choose your country from the dropdown list to see the exact documents required.
   - If your degree was obtained in the U.S., an ECE evaluation is not needed. Refer to your application portal for transcript submission instructions.
   - Example: [Required documents for Russia](official.eceDocumentRequirement).
4. **Prepare your documents:**
   - Provide certified English translations for all documents not originally in English.
     Use complete, literal, word-for-word translations in the same format as the originals.
     I recommend using [Rush Translate Services](external.rushTranslate) — they’re certified, fast, and entirely online.
   - Follow any country-specific requirements listed on the ECE website.
   - You may submit translations by mail with your other documents or via email, depending on your country’s instructions (ECE will specify this in the final application step before payment).
5. **Order your report:**
   - Create an account on the [ECE website](official.eceUSInstitutions).
   - Complete the online application and make the payment.
   - When choosing recipients, **select “The Joint Commission on National Dental Examinations (JCNDE)”** from the dropdown list to ensure your results are sent for INBDE eligibility.
   - Optionally, order an extra copy for your own records. You can always request additional copies later when submitting your CAAPID application.
   - After placing your order, follow the ECE instructions to mail or submit your educational documents according to your country’s documentation requirements.
   - You can review a [sample ECE Course-by-Course Report](official.eceSampleReport).

## Important Notes

- **Send Original Documents:** ECE requires _original documents_, not photocopies, notarized copies, faxes, or scans.
- **Document Return:** ECE will return your original documents along with your completed evaluation report.
- **Electronic Delivery:** ECE will send electronic copies of your report directly to JCNDE and any other recipients you selected during your order.
- **INBDE Eligibility:** Once JCNDE (ADA) receives your ECE report, you’ll receive a confirmation email. At that point, you become eligible to register and take the INBDE exam.

While waiting for your evaluation to be processed, you can move on to the next
step — **obtaining your DENTPIN**.
