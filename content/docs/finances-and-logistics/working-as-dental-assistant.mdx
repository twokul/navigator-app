title: Working as a Dental Assistant
description: How Foreign-Trained Dentists Can Work as Dental Assistants in the U.S.
---

If you're a foreign-trained dentist living in the U.S., working as a dental
assistant (DA) is one of the most accessible and strategic paths to gain
hands-on U.S. dental experience, earn income, and strengthen your dental school
application. Here’s a comprehensive guide based on real experiences from other
dentists who’ve done it and reliable official sources.

## Basics You Need to Know

- **No exams or U.S. dental license is required** to work as a basic dental assistant in most states.
- **You can get hired and trained on the job**, especially if you already have dental experience.
- **Foreign-trained dentists often get hired quickly** due to their knowledge and clinical background.
- Most dentists look for someone reliable, eager to learn, and able to assist effectively.
- However, you'll need additional certifications to perform certain duties like taking X-rays or polishing teeth.

## State-Specific Requirements

Dental assistant regulations **vary by state**, so always check your local dental board or the [DANB State Map]({{professional.danb.stateRequirements}}).

For example:

- **Texas**: You don’t need a certificate to work, but you need to pass a short $90 online exam to get your radiology license.
- **Washington State**: Pay $40 online for a basic license—no exams or training required.
- **Alabama**: No certification is needed to take X-rays.
- **California**: You can skip full dental assisting school. Some weekend courses (like those at [dental-specialties.com](http://www.dental-specialties.com/)) cover all you need: X-rays, CPR, OSHA, etc.
- **New York & New Jersey**: You must be licensed as a Registered Dental Assistant (RDA) to perform many clinical tasks legally.

## Certifications You Might Need

Even if you're allowed to assist without a license, **getting certified makes you more employable and boosts your pay**.

Here are the most common certifications:

1. **Radiology/X-ray Certification** – Required in many states to take dental radiographs.
2. **CPR & OSHA Training** – Often needed; many offices offer this training every two years.
3. **Coronal Polishing** – Sometimes optional, sometimes required depending on your duties.
4. **DANB Certifications** (optional but valuable):
   - **CDA** – Certified Dental Assistant
   - **COA** – Certified Orthodontic Assistant
     DANB exams are recognized in many states and enhance your credibility and pay rate.

You can get CE credits for licensing from the [ADAA website]({{professional.adaa}}).

## Why It’s Worth It for International Dentists

- No exams needed to start
- Earn U.S. dental experience while preparing for advanced standing or exams
- Enhances your dental school/residency applications
- Builds confidence with patients and dental systems
- Higher chances of acceptance and better pay with a license

## Pro Tips from Other Foreign-Trained Dentists

- **Be selective with where you work**. A good supervising dentist will let you learn, grow, and support your goals.
- **Don’t overstep**. While your knowledge may be more advanced than a regular DA, U.S. regulations limit your scope.
- **Get in early**. Some clinics let you join their CPR/OSHA training if you're already hired.
- **Use this experience to network**, get recommendation letters, and prepare for dental school.

### Can I Work as a Dental Assistant Without U.S. Exams or Licensure?

**Yes – in most states, you can start working as a dental assistant without passing any exams.**

Many dental assistants are trained on the job, and licensure is only required if you're performing specific duties like taking x-rays or advanced clinical tasks.

### If You Have a Green Card

- You are legally allowed to work in the U.S.
- You can apply to dental offices and get trained directly in-house.
- You don’t need to pass any dental licensing exams (like INBDE) to become a dental assistant.

### Getting Started as a Dental Assistant

Here’s a general path shared by others who successfully started working:

1. **Apply for jobs at dental offices.**
   - Many clinics hire and train on-site.
   - Emphasize your dental background – even as a foreign-trained dentist.
2. **Ask for support with licensure if needed.**
   - Your employer can write a letter confirming your in-house training.
   - Some states require this letter when applying for assistant registration.
3. **Take Required Short Courses (if needed):**
   - **Radiology Certification** (to take x-rays)
   - **CPR Certification**
   - **OSHA & HIPAA training**
   - **Coronal polishing (in some states)**
4. **Complete Continuing Education (CE)**
   - Free CE courses are available at [ADAA]({{professional.adaa}}).
   - These are useful for registration or to strengthen your resume.

### State-by-State Requirements

Every state has different rules for dental assistants. Examples:

- **Texas**:
  You can become a dental assistant by passing a $90 online exam — no schooling required. Radiology certification is needed only if you’ll take x-rays.
- **Washington**:
  Anyone can become a dental assistant by paying $40 for a license — no tests or classes needed.
- **Alabama**:
  No certification is needed for x-rays.
- **California**:
  You can take **weekend courses** for x-rays and CPR (e.g., [Dental Specialties Institute](http://www.dental-specialties.com/)). Many dentists will hire you if you have an x-ray license alone.
- **New York & New Jersey**:
  You must have a **Registered Dental Assistant (RDA)** license to perform most clinical tasks. Without it, you are limited in what you can legally do.

Check your state’s requirements via [DANB State Requirements Tool]({{professional.danb.stateRequirements}})

### Why Get Certified or Licensed as a Dental Assistant?

Even if your state doesn’t require it, here’s why many recommend it:

1. **Legal protection** – Avoid doing tasks that require licensure without it.
2. **Higher salary** – Certified assistants often earn more.
3. **More job offers** – Certification shows commitment and skill.
4. **Better dental school applications** – U.S. licensure or certification looks great on ASP or residency applications. It proves you’ve worked with U.S. patients and understand the clinical environment.

### Certifications from DANB

The **Dental Assisting National Board (DANB)** provides national certifications such as:

- **CDA** – Certified Dental Assistant
- **COA** – Certified Orthodontic Assistant

These certifications are valid in many states and make you more competitive.

### Summary

If you’re a dentist with a green card (or legal status):

- You can work immediately as a dental assistant in many states.
- You can be trained in-office — many offices are happy to train you.
- Check your state’s requirements for radiology, CPR, and CE credits.
- Consider getting certified for better pay, more opportunities, and a stronger resume if you plan to apply to dental school.

## Limited Licenses in Residency or Academia

In some cases (e.g., Boston University), residents or faculty can work under a
**Limited Dental License**. This is different from a dental assistant license
and allows patient care under supervision. These are **only available through a
university or hospital program** and usually require:

- DDS/DMD equivalence (or you must be accepted into a CODA-accredited program or hired by a university/clinic to apply.)
- Job offer or program enrollment
- Supervision and documentation from your program director
- High TOEFL scores (e.g., 90+ in MA)

These licenses **cannot be applied for independently** and do not lead directly to a general dental license.

Important Notes:

- **Who Gets Them?** Residents, fellows, and faculty in dental programs (e.g., BU, Harvard, Tufts)
  - **Example**: A dentist from Greece teaching at a U.S. university under a _limited faculty license_
- Licenses require annual renewal, CE courses, and DEA authorization.
- You can’t apply “cold” — you need a sponsoring director to fill out and sign the application.

Practically you usually can’t get this license on your own. You must be affiliated with an institution that supports your application and supervision.
