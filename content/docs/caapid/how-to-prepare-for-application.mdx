title: How to prepare for the CAAPID application
description: Learn how to prepare for your CAAPID application as a foreign-trained dentist — from collecting documents and test scores to organizing your binder and submitting early
---

Many foreign-trained dentists delay starting their CAAPID application, not
realizing how **lengthy and time-sensitive** the process is. Processing your
primary application can take **4–6 weeks** before it even reaches dental schools.
Some schools also require a **secondary application**, which adds another **2–6
weeks** of review time. Since schools tend to invite **early applicants for
interviews first**, starting early gives you a clear advantage.

I strongly recommend **beginning your preparations well before the CAAPID cycle
opens in early March**. While you cannot submit your application before then,
you can — and should — have every document ready. Being prepared allows you to
**submit early**, which significantly improves your chances of getting noticed by
schools and receiving interview invitations sooner.

### Key Preparation Steps Before March

- **Letters of Recommendation (LORs)** – Request them **several months in
  advance**. Recommenders often need time to write and submit.
- **Personal Statement** – Start early and expect several revisions. (Mine took
  nearly **20 drafts** before I was satisfied.)
- **Transcripts / ECE Evaluation** – Since these take weeks to process, order
  them as soon as possible.
- **INBDE & TOEFL Scores** – Ensure your scores are ready and sent directly to
  CAAPID.

By completing these steps early, you’ll be ready to submit as soon as the portal
opens — a major advantage in the selection process.

### Create an "Application Binder"

An **application binder** (digital or physical) keeps all essential information
organized for quick access throughout your journey. Include:

- Latest transcript
- Exam scores (keep copies handy) – [How to submit to
  CAAPID](official.caapidTestScores)
- Experiences – [Learn more](official.caapidExperiences)
- Achievements – [Details here](official.caapidAchievements)
- Previous applications (if any)
- Final version of your personal statement
- Log of shadowing hours – [Example of Houston Shadowing Log](official.caapidShadowingLog)
- List of potential LOR writers with emails – [How to submit LOR to CAAPID](official.caapidLORs)
- Updated CV/Resume (PDF) – [Example from the University of Washington](/files/idds-cv-template.pdf)

  Once your application is submitted, you cannot re-upload, update, or edit documents — but you can
  add new experiences or upload new files later.
