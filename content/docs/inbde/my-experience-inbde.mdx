title: My INBDE Preparation Journey
description: A firsthand account of preparing for the INBDE — what worked, what didn’t, and how I’d approach it today
---

I took the **INBDE in 2021**, during its very first cycle after the NBDE Part 1
and Part 2 exams were discontinued. At that time, **study materials were scarce**,
and many of the resources available today hadn’t yet been developed.

I came across the **TSB course** through a Facebook group and decided to enroll.
It provided solid structure and support, and I’m grateful to say I **passed the
exam on my first attempt**. Since then, TSB has likely updated its program, so I
recommend checking **recent Google reviews** from other test-takers for the most
current feedback.

If I were preparing for the INBDE today, I would likely choose either **INBDE
Bootcamp** or **INBDE Booster** as my main study resource. Both appear to be
well-organized, current, and comprehensive. I’m also a big fan of **Dr. Ryan’s
YouTube videos** — his clear, concise explanations were extremely helpful and
gave me a strong foundation.

Of course, this is just my personal experience. Always **research and compare
resources** to find what best suits your learning style.

In addition to a primary course, I highly recommend using **Dental Decks** for
reinforcement. Tools like **Google** and **ChatGPT** can also help you quickly
clarify concepts or find specific information — just remember that AI-generated
answers aren’t always accurate.

Finally, if you find it hard to stay motivated while studying alone, consider
joining **Facebook groups** or **Telegram/WhatsApp study chats**. Many students
actively share study materials, discuss clinical scenarios, and support each
other through the preparation process.
