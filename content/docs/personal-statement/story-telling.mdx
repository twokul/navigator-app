## What Is Story Telling?

Storytelling is a powerful tool that can be used to convey your message in a
more engaging and memorable way. It is a way to tell a story about your life,
your experiences, and your journey.

## How to Tell a Story?

### Hook (Introduction)

<Aside>
  Start with a vivid, memorable anecdote or image. Avoid generic openings. Immediately hint at your
  motivation.
</Aside>

**Goal:** Capture attention & set the tone.

**Why it works:** A compelling opening draws the reader in and makes them
curious about your story. You're not just a number—you're a person with a
reason to become a dentist in the U.S.

**What to include:**

- A pivotal moment, emotional insight, or unique experience.
- Reflect a quality that shows your motivation or mindset.

**Example:**

> The first time I held a mirror for a patient who hadn’t smiled in years, I
> realized dentistry was more than technique—it was restoration of dignity. That
> moment, in a modest clinic in St. Petersburg, still guides me years later as I
> seek to rebuild lives, not just teeth.

**Why this works in dentistry:** It instantly connects your _why_ with the human
side of dentistry—restoring health, confidence, and quality of life.

Other examples:

**Style: Poetic & Reflective**

> The smell of clove oil and sterilized tools was oddly comforting. I was five,
> sitting quietly in my aunt's clinic in Yerevan, watching her transform pain into
> smiles. I didn’t have the words for it then, but I knew: this was magic, and I
> wanted to learn it.

**Style: Bold & Confident**

> Dentistry is not just my profession—it is the framework through which I view
> the world. It's in the way I analyze structures, restore what's broken, and
> obsess over the smallest millimeter of change. I've lived this mindset from
> Russia to the U.S., and I’m ready to grow within it.

**Style: Relatable & Personal**

> When I moved to the U.S., I expected homesickness, cultural shock, and lots of
> paperwork. I didn’t expect how deeply I’d miss dentistry. But every time I found
> a way to stay close to the field—volunteering, assisting, shadowing—I felt at
> home again.

### Background + Motivation

<Aside>
  Avoid simply listing achievements. Contextualize experience. Show growth and insight. Connect past
  experiences to future goals.
</Aside>

**Goal:** Explain your path into dentistry and your motivation clearly.

**Why it works:** It shows your long-term dedication, how your interest evolved,
and gives context to your journey—especially important if you're a
foreign-trained dentist.

**What to include:**

- Your dental education and training abroad.
- Key experiences that shaped your interest and values.
- Cultural, clinical, or personal insights that formed your perspective.

**Example:**

> Graduating with a DDS in Kazakhstan, I began my career in a multidisciplinary
> clinic, where I soon found myself drawn to complex restorative cases and patient
> communication. What began as fascination with precision quickly grew into a
> desire to offer comprehensive care grounded in empathy and trust.

**Why this works:** It connects your professional history with personal growth
and values—critical for programs evaluating your potential as a clinician in
the U.S.

Other examples:

**Style: Factual & Structured**

> I received my DDS degree from [University] in Russia, where I trained in
> restorative and preventive dentistry. During my internship year, I managed
> complex cases in both public and private settings, gaining proficiency in
> clinical diagnosis, treatment planning, and patient communication.

**Style: Analytical & Insightful**

> My clinical training in Moldova emphasized efficiency and volume, often
> treating over 10 patients daily. This environment taught me how to manage
> high-pressure cases, but it also left me craving a deeper, evidence-based
> approach to care—one I began to discover while shadowing U.S. dentists.

**Style: Humble & Honest**

> While my dental education abroad was intensive, transitioning to the U.S.
> system made me realize how much more I could learn. From understanding insurance
> models to incorporating digital workflows, I saw gaps—but also felt excitement
> about filling them.

### Turning Point: Why the U.S.

<Aside>
  Show character and resilience. Highlight motivations beyond a checklist of achievements. Use
  storytelling to humanize the applicant - create an authentic narrative, balancing vulnerability
  and strength.
</Aside>

**Goal:** Show your reasoning for pursuing licensure and further education in
the U.S.

**Why it works:** Committees want to understand your motivation, maturity, and
readiness—not just your credentials.

**What to include:**

- When and why you decided to pursue U.S. licensure.
- Any challenges you've overcome (language, immigration, financial, etc.).
- What you admire about the U.S. system (e.g., technology, collaboration,
  patient-centered care).

**Example:**

> After moving to the U.S. in 2019, I realized how different yet inspiring the
> dental care model was—centered on preventative care, patient rights, and
> multidisciplinary collaboration. Although the transition was challenging, I
> began working as a dental assistant to immerse myself, improve my language, and
> adapt to the culture.

**Why this works:** It shows resilience, adaptability, and genuine interest—not
just a pursuit of prestige or immigration status.

Other Examples:

**Style: Storytelling**

> I arrived in the U.S. in 2019 with a suitcase, a license that didn’t transfer,
> and a deep desire to keep helping people. Navigating TOEFL, unfamiliar systems,
> and part-time jobs was humbling—but it taught me resilience, patience, and how
> much I truly want to be a dentist here.

**Style: Reflective**

> Uprooting my life to move across continents was never just a logistical shift.
> It meant rebuilding my identity—this time in a language and culture I wasn't
> born into. Yet, every challenge—from licensing exams to cultural
> integration—brought me closer to who I'm becoming: a more versatile, global
> dentist.

### U.S. Experience & Growth

<Aside>
  Show don't tell: Let experiences demonstrate knowledge and fit. Highlight hands-on experience,
  cultural adaptability, and insight told through story rather than abstract statements.
</Aside>

**Goal:** Demonstrate your preparation and familiarity with the U.S. dental
field.

**Why it works:** Shows that you've taken steps to integrate—clinically,
culturally, and ethically.

**What to include:**

- Observerships, assistant jobs, volunteer work, or shadowing.
- Professional growth: improved communication, patient care, clinical skills.
- New perspectives on ethics, teamwork, or technology.

**Example:**

> Working in a private practice in Houston and volunteering at a mobile dental
> clinic, I saw how trust is built through communication, not just credentials. I
> adapted my style, learned from every assistant and hygienist, and now feel
> confident in managing diverse patient needs within the U.S. standard of care.

**Why this works:** Shows humility, action, and transformation—exactly what
programs want to see.

Other Examples:

**Style: Detailed & Professional**

> As a dental assistant in New York, I supported treatments in prosthodontics
> and implantology, assisted in digital impressions and lab communications, and
> helped patients navigate pre- and post-operative care. This hands-on role helped
> bridge my previous training with U.S. standards.

**Style: Personal & Passionate**

> The first time I translated treatment options to a nervous patient, something
> clicked. I wasn't just assisting—I was building trust, demystifying dentistry,
> and making someone feel safe. These moments reminded me why I belong in this
> profession.

### Your Values & What You'll Contribute

<Aside>
  Be specific and sincere about why the program matters. Connect your future goals with what the
  program offers making the reader see a clear fit. Avoid flattery—focus on alignment.
</Aside>

**Goal:** Highlight the values and qualities that make you a strong fit.

**Why it works:** Moves from "what I've done" to "who I am" and "what I
bring"—making your application more memorable.

**What to include:**

- Personal qualities like empathy, leadership, curiosity, teamwork.
- Mention any mentorship, research, or education contributions.
- Emphasize your long-term commitment to the profession.

**Example:**

> Throughout my career, I've been drawn to mentorship and collaboration. In my
> previous clinic, I helped younger dentists refine techniques and co-led a
> patient education initiative. In the U.S., I hope to not only grow clinically
> but contribute to a community of learning and care.

**Why this works:** Admissions committees want clinicians who elevate the
classroom, the clinic, and the profession—not just pass exams.

Other Examples:

**Style: Visionary**

> I envision building a practice that bridges cultures, offers education
> alongside care, and integrates new technologies for underserved populations. An
> Advanced Standing Program will not only validate my credentials—it will sharpen
> them, preparing me to lead with skill and empathy.

**Style: Targeted**

> I'm drawn to Advanced Standing Programs for their commitment to public health,
> interdisciplinary learning, and mentorship-driven training. I'm confident the
> program will give me the clinical, academic, and ethical foundation I need to
> serve my future patients with integrity and excellence.
