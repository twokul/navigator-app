---

<Aside>
  If you want to learn more about INBDE, please read [the official
  guide](https://jcnde.ada.org/-/media/project/ada-organization/ada/jcnde/files/inbde_candidate_guide.pdf?rev=b49a788e7e8240bdb0fab74a84ccd2c1&hash=F8F7A3DE1C2F54135ACBF118F2276222)
  and the link to our [INBDE guide](/c/applying-to-advanced-standing/inbde-guide).

The next step involves scheduling the INBDE (Integrated National Board Dental
Examination), which can be taken only in the U.S. and Canada. It means that you
would need to travel to the these countries to take the exam. There is no other
way. Typically students register at least **3 months** in advance to be well
prepared.

## Steps

- Follow [the link to apply for the
  INBDE.]({{official.inbde}}/inbde-apply)
- Pay for INBDE.
- After your purchase, you will receive an email with instructions on
  registering for the exam via [Prometric Center](https://www.prometric.com/).
  Follow the guidelines there to schedule your first and second exam date. You can
  choose them according to your preparation level: either at the nearest available
  date or further away (2-6 months in advance). You can also schedule your exam
  later, once you spend some time preparing for it you understand how much more
  time you need to be ready to take the exam. Then you can more confidently
  schedule it.

## Important Notes

**JCNDE** will receive the electronic copy of your ECE report within few days,
but they won't look into it till you obtain your Dentpin, apply for the INBDE
exam through their website and Pay the necessary fees. After you do all that
JCNDE will match your Dentpin application with your ECE report by themselves
and they will email you an eligibility number, which you can use to book your
exam through the prometric website. Everything in this system is connected and
you don't want to miss any of these steps. Also, make sure to check your spam
folder in case you can't find important emails.
