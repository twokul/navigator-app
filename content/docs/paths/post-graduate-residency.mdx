description: (Dental residency - GPR/AEGD, or Specialty Programs)

The accredited post-graduate programs (residency programs) for international
dentists in the U.S. typically include specialized residencies in areas such as:

**Advanced Education in General Dentistry (AEGD)**

Focuses on clinical dentistry and applied basic sciences, and is designed for
recent graduates who want to improve their skills as general practitioners.
AEGD programs are usually one-year programs, but some may extend to two years.
They are typically similar to an extension of dental school clinical practice,
with more patients and less supervision. AEGD programs are usually dental
school-based, but that's not always the case. They offer hands-on support,
expanded functions, and a different level of medical experience than GPRs. AEGD
programs also allow residents to tailor their experiences based on individual
interests, such as the option to undergo training in IV sedation.

**General Practice Residency (GPR)**

Focuses on medical management of patients and is typically associated with a
hospital. GPR programs typically allow students to work with medically complex
patients as part of a larger medical team. GPR programs are usually one year,
but some cover two years.

**Various Other Specialty Programs**

There are various Dental Specialties such as Endodontics, Orthodontics,
Periodontics, Prosthodontics, Pediatric Dentistry, Oral and Maxillofacial
Surgery, and more.

A **dental residency program for foreign-trained dentists** provides specialized
education and training in a specific subject (M.S./specialty porgrams). It is
similar to a post-graduation program in your home country. One can pursue a
specialty in Periodontics, Prosthodontics, Endodontics, Orofacial pain,
Orthodontics, Pediatric Dentistry, and Oral and Maxillofacial Radiology. The
program may be 2 - 3 years long, depending on the school and specialty. Look at
it as a continuation of a bachelor's program acquired in your home country,
which lets you dive deeper in one specialty and hence save time. Also a
residency program is cheaper than D.D.S. But it has a drawback: these programs
allow you to practice only in certain states in the U.S.A. (find the list of
states below) and they are highly competitive.

Admissions to a residency program are facilitated via the [National Matching
Service](https://natmatch.com/), making it even more competitive. As I said,
most states do not provide licensure through residency path as they require
international dentists to graduate from an accredited US dental school. After
completing Residency program you will be able to practice only in a limited
number of states.

### States Allowing Licensure After Residency:

A few states in the U.S. allow international dentists to apply for a dental
license after completing an accredited residency program, without necessarily
graduating from a U.S. dental school. But each state has specific requirements
and guidelines. For the latest update, please google the states yourself as the
terms and conditions can change every year.

Please, it’s very important, verify the current regulations with the
state dental board as policies can change. It’s your best source of up-to-date
and verified information (find each state’s board info
[here](https://www.ada.org/resources/licensure/dental-licensure-by-state-map)).

**Contact the departments directly before making any decisions. This is
only to make your research easier. If you find any mistakes or if I have missed
any you may know about let me know.**
