title: Quick Overview
description: A concise overview of the key steps for applying to Advanced Standing Programs in the U.S.
---

This is a quick step-by-step overview of the process. If you're looking for a
detailed breakdown, continue to the [Detailed
Guide](/c/applying-to-advanced-standing/detailed-guide/introduction).

There are **eight main steps** to applying for an Advanced Standing Program.

---

### 1. Register and Get Your DENTPIN

Your DENTPIN is a unique ID number required for all dental exams.
Get your DENTPIN on the official website [here](official.dentpin).

---

### 2. Get a **Course-by-Course Evaluation** of Your Foreign Degree

All evaluations must go through [ECE](official.ece). This is required to
register for and take the INBDE exam.

When ordering your evaluation, make sure to send a copy to:

<address>
  The Joint Commission on National Dental Examinations (JCNDE) <br />
  211 E. Chicago Ave <br />
  Chicago, IL 60611
</address>

The ECE evaluation is sufficient for the INBDE. However, some schools—such as
**Loma Linda University (CA)**—also require a **WES evaluation** for admissions.
Always confirm specific requirements directly with each school.

---

### 3. Register for the INBDE

Once JCNDE confirms receipt of your evaluation, you’ll receive an email with instructions to register for the [INBDE](official.inbde).  
You’ll have **six months to prepare** from the date of payment.

---

### 4. Prepare for the Exam

Study materials and preparation strategies for INBDE can be found [here](/c/related-paths-and-resources/inbde-study-materials).  
Expect **4–6 months** of intensive study—about **5 hours per day**, depending on your readiness.

The INBDE uses a **pass/fail** system:

- **75 or above** → Pass (score not shown)
- **74 or below** → Fail (score shown)

---

### 5. Take the TOEFL

The best study resource I’ve found is [Notefull](https://www.notefull.com/getting-started/).  
You can also explore YouTube for exam insights—this [channel](https://www.youtube.com/@TSTPrep) offers a wealth of useful content.

Use the official [TOEFL website](official.toefl) to access and purchase practice tests.  
Take them multiple times to practice timing and simulate real exam conditions.

The TOEFL has **four sections**: reading, listening, speaking, and writing.  
Aim for a **score of 100+** (out of 120).

---

### 6. Submit Your Documents to the Chosen Schools

After passing both exams (INBDE and TOEFL), submit your documents via the [CAAPID Application](official.caapid).  
Learn more about the CAAPID process—including key do’s and don’ts—[here](/c/caapid/secondary-application).

---

### 7. Wait for Interview Invitations

If shortlisted, schools will invite you for an interview, which usually includes two parts:

1. The [interview itself](/c/personal-interview/introduction) — covering personal, academic, and professional topics.
2. A [bench test](/c/bench-test/introduction) — where you may be asked to perform procedures such as fillings, crown preparations, or amalgams.

---

### 8. Receive Your Acceptance Letter

If successful, you'll receive an acceptance letter with detailed next steps from
your school. Congratulations — this is the final step in your application
journey!

---

### A Note on Finances

The process and education are **costly** — expect total expenses between
**$200,000–$300,000**. Financial aid or loans are typically available **only**
to U.S. citizens or green card holders. If financing is uncertain, consider your
options carefully before applying.

---

### Considering a Residency Instead?

Foreign-trained dentists applying to **Residency Programs** follow nearly the
same steps. The only difference is that applications go through the [ADEA
Postdoctoral Application Support Service (PASS)](official.pass).
