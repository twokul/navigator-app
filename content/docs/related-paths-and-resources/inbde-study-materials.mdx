## More ways to prepare for INBDE

There is plenty of study material for candidates to pass the INBDE, such as the
Dental Deck, Mosby, Kaplan, Dentin, and the First Aid book. Additionally, there
are many helpful files available online and supplementary study materials online
in the various study groups on social media (search for the Facebook INBDE study
groups).

We highly recommend choosing one/two sources for studying to avoid getting
overwhelmed with information. **The key is to go over as many practice questions
as possible**.

You can purchase some of the books mentioned below on Facebook groups (in used
condition).

### Dental Decks

Dental decks are available in various formats such as flashcards, booklets,
online practice tests, etc. I would highly recommend the Dental Decks as study
material, and it is available in both print and online options. Dental Decks
offer users more than 2,700 comprehensive flashcards spanning key study areas
tested in the INBDE. Cards are classified into 16 areas of study, allowing users
flexibility to break down areas that they are weak at. Additionally, it consists
of an oral pathology booklet with 95 oral pathology photos and radiographs.

You can access more details from the [website]({{study.dentalDecks}}).
