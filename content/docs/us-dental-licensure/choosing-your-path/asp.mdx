description: The most common pathway to earn a U.S. DDS/DMD degree and qualify for dental licensure
---

The **Advanced Standing Program (ASP)** is the most common route for
foreign-trained dentists to earn a U.S. dental degree (DDS or DMD).  
International dentists have two main options:

1. **Traditional DDS program** – starting from year one alongside U.S.
   students and completing the full four-year program.
2. **Advanced Standing Program (ASP)** – a shortened track designed
   specifically for foreign-trained dentists.

### What is an ASP?

An ASP allows qualified dentists from abroad to bypass undergraduate coursework
and the early years of dental school. Instead, you join directly in the final
two (sometimes three) years of a CODA-accredited dental program.  
Once completed, you graduate with a U.S. DDS/DMD degree, which makes you fully
equivalent to any U.S.-trained dentist.

**Important:** This is the **only pathway** that enables
foreign-trained dentists to earn a U.S. dental degree and become eligible for a
practicing license in **any U.S. state**.

### Typical Entry Requirements

- Passing the **Integrated National Board Dental Examination (INBDE)**
- English proficiency via the **TOEFL**
- Graduation from an accredited foreign dental school
- Submission of official transcripts

In addition, many schools require applicants to complete:

- A **psychomotor bench test**
- **Case presentations**
- A **formal interview**

### Finding ASP Programs

You can view the official list of accredited schools on the [ADEA
website](official.adea.dentalInstitutions).

  Keep in mind: Some schools offering ASPs are not included on this list, so you may need to
  manually check the websites of CODA-accredited dental schools.
