title: Post-Graduate Residency Path
description: Exploring U.S. residency programs (AEGD, GPR, and specialties) as a pathway to licensure for foreign-trained dentists
---

Accredited post-graduate programs (residencies) in the U.S. offer international
dentists advanced training opportunities. These include both general residency
programs and specialty tracks.

**Advanced Education in General Dentistry (AEGD)**  
AEGD programs focus on clinical dentistry and applied basic sciences. They are
designed for recent graduates who want to strengthen their skills as general
practitioners. Most AEGD programs last one year, though some extend to two.

- Typically school-based, but not always.
- Provide extensive patient care experience with less supervision than dental
  school.
- Allow residents to tailor experiences (e.g., IV sedation training).

**General Practice Residency (GPR)**  
GPR programs emphasize hospital-based patient care and medical management.

- Residents work with medically complex patients as part of an integrated
  medical team.
- Programs are usually one year, with some lasting two.

**Specialty Programs**  
Specialty residencies (2–3 years, depending on school and focus) allow deeper
training in a chosen field such as:

- Endodontics
- Orthodontics
- Periodontics
- Prosthodontics
- Pediatric Dentistry
- Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery
- Orofacial Pain, Oral Radiology, and more

### Key Considerations for Foreign-Trained Dentists

- A residency program is often cheaper than a DDS/DMD degree.
- It provides advanced, specialized training similar to post-graduate programs
  in your home country.
- **Limitation**: Completing a residency alone does not guarantee licensure in
  most states. Only a handful of states accept licensure by residency (see list
  below).
- Admissions are highly competitive and managed via the
  [National Matching Service](official.natmatch).

### States Accepting Licensure by Residency

A few states allow international dentists to apply for a license after completing
an accredited residency program (without earning a U.S. DDS/DMD). Each state has
specific requirements, and regulations may change, so always confirm with the
state’s dental board.

As of the latest available information, these states may allow licensure through
the residency path:

- [Connecticut](states.connecticut.dentistLicensure)
- [Florida](states.florida.dentistLicensure)
- [Illinois](states.illinois.dentistLicensure)
- [Michigan](states.michigan.dentistLicensure)
- [Mississippi](states.mississippi.dentistLicensure)
- [Minnesota](states.minnesota.dentistLicensure)

- [Washington](states.washington.dentistLicensure)

**Important:** Regulations change frequently. Always confirm with the
[state dental board](professional.ada.dentalLicensureMap) before making decisions. Contact departments directly for the most
accurate and up-to-date information.
