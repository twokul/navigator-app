When I first started my journey toward getting into a U.S. dental school through
an **Advanced Standing Program (ASP)**, I knew the **bench test examination**
was another hurdle ahead. It’s a crucial part of the selection process, designed
to evaluate **clinical skills, problem-solving abilities, and how well we adapt
to U.S. dental standards**.

At first, the whole process seemed overwhelming, but after going through it
myself, I can share what I've learned about how it works, what to expect, and
how to prepare effectively.

### What Is the Bench Test?

The bench test is a **hands-on clinical exam** where you’re tested on your
technical skills and ability to make clinical decisions. Each dental school has
its own format, evaluation criteria, and exercises, so no two tests are exactly
the same.

Typically, the bench test includes tasks such as:

- **Cavity preparations** (Class II, Class III, etc.)
- **Crown preparations** (Full metal, PFM, all-ceramic)
- **Restorations** (Composite, amalgam)
- **Prosthodontic skills** (Wax-ups, removable prosthetics)
- **Endodontic access openings**
- **Clinical reasoning and treatment planning**

Not every school requires a bench test, but for those that do, the **cost can
range anywhere from $500 to $1,000 or more**.

### How the Bench Test Is Structured

Even though each school has its own requirements, the general structure tends to
be similar. Here's what I experienced.

#### Clinical Skills Assessment

This is the part where you work on typodont teeth and perform specific
procedures under strict time limits. They evaluate:

- **Precision in tooth preparation**
- **Margins, taper, and occlusal clearance**
- **Hand skills and ergonomic efficiency**
- **Proper use of dental instruments**

Every school has its own grading system, but I found it super helpful to follow
the general guidelines used for U.S. licensure exams. If you want to check out
[ADEX Dental Criteria](https://adextesting.org/adex-dental/adex-dental-forms/).

You can also access the [preparation guideline
manual](/files/perio-restorative-manual.pdf).

#### Case-Based Written Examination

Some schools include a **written exam** alongside the hands-on part. This can
involve:

- **Analyzing a patient case** (radiographs, clinical charts, photographs)
- **Multiple-choice questions** (covering diagnostics, prosthodontics,
  radiology, etc.)
- **Writing a treatment plan**
- **Documenting a procedure as clinical notes**

For example, Western University's bench test had **30+ questions in 1 hour**,
including both multiple-choice and a written treatment plan.

#### Time Management and Handling Pressure

One of the hardest parts is staying calm under time constraints while ensuring
quality work. The test is designed to mimic real-world dental practice, where
decisions must be fast and precise.
