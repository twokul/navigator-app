title: Step 8. Invitation to Interview
description: What to expect after submitting your CAAPID application and how to strengthen your profile while waiting for an interview invitation
---

After submitting your **CAAPID and supplemental applications**, the next major
milestone is **receiving an interview invitation**. Some applicants may receive
**multiple invites**, while others may not receive any — it all depends on
several factors, including:

- **Overall application strength** (GPA, INBDE, and TOEFL scores)
- **Clinical and work experience** (both U.S. and international)
- **Extracurricular activities and achievements**
- **Quality of your personal statement and recommendation letters**

Because the selection process is highly competitive, it’s important to **stay
proactive** while waiting.

## How to Use the Waiting Period Effectively

### 1. Improve Your Communication and Presentation Skills

Schools assess your ability to express yourself clearly and confidently. Practice speaking English fluently and refine your presentation style to leave a strong impression.

### 2. Continue Strengthening Your Profile

You can **update your CAAPID application** even after submission. When you upload new documents or achievements, schools receive notifications — potentially **boosting your visibility**.

> **Tip:** If you haven’t heard from schools by January, follow up with updates and express continued interest in an interview.

**Example:**  
After submitting my CAAPID application in **mid-March**, I kept updating my profile. When I earned my **Registered Dental Assistant (RDA) license** and was **invited to speak at a U.S. dental conference**, I added these to CAAPID. This helped highlight my professional growth and increased my chances of being noticed.

### 3. Prepare for Bench Tests (If Required)

Some schools require a **bench test**, a hands-on evaluation of your clinical skills. Review common exercises such as **crown preparations, cavity restorations,** and **wax-ups** to be ready when called.

### 4. Familiarize Yourself with Interview Formats

Dental schools use various interview styles — preparation is key:

- **Traditional One-on-One (1:1)** – Direct interview with a faculty member.
- **Multiple Mini Interviews (MMI)** – Short, timed scenarios assessing communication, ethics, and decision-making.
- **Problem-Based Learning (PBL)** – Group discussion where candidates analyze and solve a **clinical case**.
- **Panel Interviews** – A group of faculty members conducting a formal interview.

### 5. Stay Positive and Confident

Confidence has a major impact on how you come across. Even if you don’t receive an immediate invitation, **keep learning, stay active, and maintain optimism**.

## Final Tip

Use this waiting period to **refine your skills, gain new experiences, and prepare for different interview types**. Each improvement — no matter how small — can help you secure an interview and, ultimately, **get accepted into your desired dental program**.

Interviews at most schools include two key parts: a [personal interview](/c/personal-interview/introduction) and a [bench examination](/c/bench-test/introduction).
