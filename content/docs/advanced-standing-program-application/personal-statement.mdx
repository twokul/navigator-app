### What Is a Personal Statement?

A **personal statement** is a written essay that provides insight into who you
are, your experiences, and what motivates you to pursue a particular field of
study or profession. It is commonly required for **college, graduate school, and
professional program applications**, including **medical and dental schools, law
schools, and scholarships**.

Unlike a **resume** or **CV**, which lists achievements and experiences, a
personal statement tells a **story**â€”it is your chance to **humanize your
application** and help admissions committees understand what makes you a great
fit for their program.
