title: Limited and Faculty Licenses
description: Alternative licensure routes for foreign-trained dentists through faculty or institutional positions in select U.S. states.
---

Some U.S. states offer an alternative path for exceptionally qualified
foreign-trained dentists to practice under **faculty or limited dental licenses**.
These licenses allow dentists to work in specific institutional settings such as
dental schools, hospitals, or public health clinics under supervision.

In **Massachusetts**, for example, there are two main types of limited
licensure:

### **Dental Intern Limited Licensure**

This license allows foreign-trained dentists to work under the supervision of a
Massachusetts-licensed dentist in approved settings such as public health
clinics, hospitals, dental schools, or correctional facilities. The license is
valid for **one year** and can be renewed annually for up to **five years**. To
extend the license beyond five years, applicants must pass the **NERB (North
East Regional Examining Board)**.

### **Full-Time Faculty Limited Licensure**

This license allows foreign-trained dentists to practice as full-time faculty
members within a dental school in Massachusetts, also under the supervision of a
licensed dentist. Faculty licenses are renewed **annually** and can be renewed
**indefinitely**. For more details, visit the [Massachusetts Board of Dentistry
website](states.massachusetts.limitedGeneral).

Similar faculty or limited licensure options are also available in **Nebraska,
Tennessee, and Maine**.

However, one challenge with this route is that universities typically do not
publicly advertise positions open to foreign-trained dentists. Applicants often
need to **proactively search university websites** and **contact program
directors directly** to inquire about available roles. In most cases, a **valid
job offer** is required before applying for a faculty or limited license.
