title: Dental School Loans Guide
description: Understanding your loan options as a U.S. resident or international student in a U.S. dental program

One of the first realities you face after getting accepted into dental school is
the **financial commitment**. These programs can cost **over $80,000 per year**
in tuition alone — and that’s before housing, insurance, and daily expenses.
While I was fortunate to be a **U.S. permanent resident** by the time I applied,
I know many go through this journey as **international students**, where loan
options differ dramatically depending on visa and residency status.

## If You’re a U.S. Citizen or Green Card Holder

As a U.S. citizen or permanent resident, you’re eligible for **federal student
loans**, which are the most flexible and reliable options available.

### Federal Loans (via FAFSA)

Apply through the **Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA)** to access:

- **Direct Unsubsidized Loans**
  - Annual limit: **$20,500**
  - **Fixed interest rate** (typically lower than private loans)
  - **No co-signer required**
  - Interest accrues while in school, but payments can be **deferred**

- **Graduate PLUS Loans**
  - Covers the **remaining cost of attendance**
  - Requires only a **basic credit check**
  - Can borrow up to the **full cost (tuition + living)**
  - Eligible for **income-driven repayment** and **Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF)** if you qualify later

<Aside>
  Even if you don’t expect grants, always complete FAFSA — it’s required for all federal loans.
</Aside>

### Private Loans (Optional)

You can also explore **private loans** through lenders such as **Sallie Mae**,
**Discover**, or **SoFi**. These may offer lower interest rates for borrowers
with excellent credit, but note:

- Repayment options are **less flexible**
- Most **don’t offer forbearance or forgiveness**
- **Interest accrues immediately**

## If You’re an International Student (F-1, H-4, etc.)

International students aren’t eligible for federal loans, but several private
lenders can help finance your education.

### Private Loans Requiring a U.S. Co-Signer

Most lenders — including **Sallie Mae**, **Earnest**, and **MPower Financing** —
offer loans to international students **with a U.S. co-signer** who:

- Is a **citizen or permanent resident**
- Has a **strong credit history**
- Agrees to **repay the loan** if you cannot

This is the most common path for international students in **Advanced Standing
Programs**, where scholarships are limited.

### No Co-Signer Loans (Limited Options)

A few lenders offer **no-co-signer loans**, but they’re harder to find and often
carry higher interest rates.

**Examples include:**

- **MPower Financing** — available for select graduate programs, including some
  dental schools.
- **Prodigy Finance** — offers loans for specific institutions and programs.

Always verify your school’s eligibility before applying.

### Timing Matters

Most schools **recommend waiting** to apply for loans until closer to enrollment
because:

- Loan pre-approvals **expire in 30–60 days**
- You’ll need **valid financial proof** for your visa and I-20

For instance, **USC advises** students to finalize private loans around **April**
for summer start dates.

## Proof of Funds for I-20 (F-1 Visa)

To receive your I-20, you must show proof you can afford your studies. Accepted
forms of proof include:

- **Bank statements** (personal or family)
- **Sponsor letters** of financial support
- **Bank solvency letters**
- **Pre-approved loan letters** (timed within validity limits)

Expect to show proof covering **$80,000–$150,000 per year**, depending on your
program.

<Aside>
  Schools cannot issue an I-20 until your financial documentation meets their standards.

## Managing Loans Responsibly

Whether you’re a resident or an international student:

- **Borrow only what you need** — especially for high-interest private loans.
- Understand **repayment terms** and **deferment options**.
- Explore **side income opportunities** (e.g., research assistantships, OPT).
- Consult your **financial aid office** — they can help compare options and
  identify potential grants.

## Final Thoughts

Paying for dental school is a major financial challenge, and your **immigration
status** shapes your options. If you’re a **U.S. citizen or green card holder**,
federal loans should be your **first choice** — they’re safer, lower-risk, and
offer repayment flexibility. For **international students**, financing is still
possible but often requires a **co-signer** and careful planning.

Many students successfully fund their programs through **a mix of loans,
personal savings, family help, and sponsors**. The key is to **start early,
research thoroughly**, and treat every borrowing decision as part of your
long-term financial plan.
