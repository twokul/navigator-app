title: Final Tips for a Strong Letter of Recommendation (LOR) Strategy
description: Key strategies to maximize the impact of your recommendation letters for U.S. dental school applications

Strong recommendation letters can make a powerful difference in your dental
school application. By choosing the right recommenders, preparing them with
helpful materials, and ensuring timely submission, you can secure letters that
truly strengthen your profile.

## Choose Recommenders Who Know You Well

A **personalized and detailed** letter is far more valuable than a generic one
from a well-known individual. Select recommenders who can genuinely speak about
your skills, growth, and character.

## Ensure Diversity in Perspectives

Each letter should emphasize **different skills, qualities, and experiences** to
create a complete, well-rounded picture of you as an applicant. Avoid repetition
between letters.

## Prioritize Quality Writing

Effective letters are **structured, clear, and filled with specific examples**
rather than general compliments. Encourage your recommenders to include concrete
instances that show your strengths in action.

## Follow School-Specific Requirements

Always check individual program guidelines. Some schools require letters from
**a U.S. dentist**, **a science professor**, or **a dean**. Ensure you meet
these criteria to avoid disqualification.

By thoughtfully selecting your recommenders and ensuring each letter highlights
a **unique and meaningful** part of your journey, youâ€™ll present yourself as a
**capable, motivated, and well-prepared candidate** ready to succeed in dental
school.
