description: Final step for foreign-trained dentists—earn your license to practice in the U.S. after completing the DDS/DMD program

After completing your **DDS or DMD degree** through an Advanced Standing
program, you’ll have several career paths to choose from — such as becoming an
**associate dentist**, **starting your own practice**, or **joining a dental
school faculty** in the U.S.

Before you can begin practicing, you must **take and pass a state licensure
exam**. Each state has its own specific licensing requirements, so make sure to
review the criteria for the state where you plan to live and work. You can find
detailed information about each state’s process on their official dental board
website.
