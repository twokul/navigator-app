title: Step 6. Take the TOEFL examination
---

The next step to achieve a DDS degree is to clear the Test of English as a
Foreign Language (TOEFL). It is a standardized test that measures the English
Language ability of non-native speakers that wish to enroll in a university in
the U.S. and over 150 other countries.

<Aside>
  TOEFL is the same when you take it inside/outside the U.S. Examiners get the recordings online,
  and you never know where they are based, e.g., your evaluator might be in Singapore while you took
  the exam in the U.K.
</Aside>

The TOEFL test is a highly competitive exam, and candidates are scored on a
scale from 0 to 120. Most U.S. universities consider a score of 100 and above as
a good score. However, all the universities have specific TOEFL eligibility
criteria, which you should check on their website.
