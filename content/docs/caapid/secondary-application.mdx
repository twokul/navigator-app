The **secondary application** is a crucial stage in the **dental school
admissions process**.

Some schools include their **supplemental questions** directly within the
**CAAPID portal’s Program Materials section**, while others send separate
invitations via email. Not all schools require a secondary application, but for
those that do, the **format, deadlines, and requirements** can vary widely.

After submitting your **primary CAAPID application**, you’ll typically begin
receiving **supplemental requests** from schools. These often come with
**additional fees** ranging from **$50 to $300**, with an average of around
**$200 per school**.

## What to Expect

### Essay Questions

Expect essay prompts that may overlap with CAAPID topics but also explore your **motivation**, **personal growth**, or **alignment with the school’s mission**. Tailor each response carefully to the specific program.

### School-Specific Assessments

Some schools include extra assessments to evaluate your judgment and communication skills.

#### Casper Test

A situational judgment test assessing non-cognitive and interpersonal skills (used by UCLA).

#### Other School-Specific Tests

Some programs may have unique assessments or questionnaires. Always check each school’s website for updated details.

### Direct Score Submission

Many schools require **official TOEFL and INBDE score reports** sent directly from testing services —  
**ETS** for TOEFL and the **ADA** for INBDE. Even if you’ve already uploaded scores through CAAPID, you’ll often need to purchase and send separate reports as instructed by each program.

## How to Approach the Secondary Application

### 1. Balance Quality and Timing

Some schools prioritize applicants based on how quickly the secondary application is submitted.  
Strive for a **balance between thoughtful responses and timely submission**.

### 2. Provide New and Relevant Insights

Use this opportunity to share **new experiences**, **recent accomplishments**, or **personal reflections** not covered in your CAAPID application.

### 3. Be Clear and Impactful

Avoid one-line answers that seem disinterested or overly long responses that lose focus. Aim for **clarity, structure, and substance**.

### 4. Demonstrate Growth and Strength

Highlight moments of **resilience**, **adaptability**, **leadership**, and **problem-solving**—qualities dental schools value highly.

### 5. Prepare for Assessments

If your target schools use Casper, Kira, or similar tools, practice with sample questions and time yourself to simulate real conditions.

A **well-prepared and genuine secondary application** can make a significant difference.

Since some schools **begin evaluating candidates based on these responses**,
your essays and assessments are a key opportunity to **stand out and strengthen
your candidacy**.
