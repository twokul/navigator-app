title: Steps to Ensure Your Letters Are Submitted on Time
---

Getting strong recommendation letters is not just about who writes them, but
also how and when they are submitted. Follow these six steps to secure timely,
high-quality letters.

### Step 1: Choose & Contact Your Recommenders Early

- **Start 3â€“4 months before** the CAAPID portal opens.
- Give them plenty of time to write a thoughtful, detailed letter.

### Step 2: Make the Request Professionally

- Politely ask your recommenders and provide a brief reminder of **how they know
  you** (e.g., "I was in your Organic Chemistry class and worked on a research
  project under your supervision.").
- Clearly state the **submission deadline** in your request.

### Step 3: Provide Supporting Documents

To help your recommenders write a **strong and specific** letter, give them:

- **Your CV/resume**
- **Your personal statement**
- **A list of key achievements, extracurriculars, and relevant experiences**

**Example:** If you volunteered at a dental clinic, remind them of specific
experiences that show your passion for the field.

### Step 4: Explain the Submission Process

- If your recommender is unfamiliar with CAAPID and [Liaison
  Letters](https://help.liaisonedu.com/Liaison_Letters_Help_Center), provide
  **clear instructions** on how to submit the letter.
- Offer to assist them with any technical difficulties.

### Step 5: Send a Reminder Before the Deadline

- **One to two weeks before** the deadline, send a short **reminder email**
  thanking them in advance.
- This ensures they remember to submit it on time.

### Step 6: Follow Up with Gratitude

- Once the letter is submitted, send a **thank-you email** to show appreciation.
- If appropriate, consider giving a small gift (e.g., a coffee shop gift card)
  as a token of appreciation.

Be aware that some schools allow you to upload more LORs, or even email them
directly with any additional recommendation letters. The application process
from start to interviews may take 6+ month which means you have enough time to
plan and add more activities and experiences to your application (CAAPID allows
you to add them after submission). You can ask for more LORs along the way if
you think the new recommender will make a difference.
