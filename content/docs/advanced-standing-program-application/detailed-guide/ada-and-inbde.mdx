The next step is registering for the **Integrated National Board Dental
Examination (INBDE)**, which can be taken **only in the U.S. or Canada**. You
will need to travel to one of these countries to take the exam—there are no
remote or international testing options. Most students register **at least three
months in advance** to allow enough time for preparation and scheduling.

# Steps to Register

1. Go to the [ADA INBDE Application Page](official.inbdeApply).
2. Submit your application and **pay the exam fee**.
3. Once your payment is processed, you’ll receive an **email with instructions** on how to schedule your exam through [Prometric Testing Centers](external.prometric).
4. Follow the Prometric instructions to schedule your first and second exam dates.  
   You can:
   - Select the **earliest available date** if you’re ready.
   - Or choose a **later date (2–6 months out)** if you need more preparation time.
   - You can also **delay scheduling** until you’re confident about your readiness.

## Important Notes

- The **Joint Commission on National Dental Examinations (JCNDE)** will receive your **ECE report electronically** within a few days. However, they will **not review it** until:
  - You have obtained your **DENTPIN**,
  - Completed your **INBDE application**, and
  - Paid the **exam fee**.
- Once all requirements are met, **JCNDE will automatically match** your ECE report with your DENTPIN and send you an **eligibility number**.
- You’ll need this eligibility number to **book your exam** through the Prometric website.
- Be sure to **check your email (including spam/junk folders)** for updates and your eligibility notice, as missing this step can delay your exam scheduling.

**Tip:** Keep digital copies of all confirmations and emails. The process
involves multiple systems (ADA, JCNDE, ECE, Prometric), so maintaining records
will help you resolve any issues quickly.
