  to one of these countries to take the exam.

The **INBDE** (Integrated National Board Dental Examination) is a **two-day exam**:

- **Day 1:** Full day with **360 questions**
- **Day 2:** Half day with **140 questions**

You can select a **Prometric testing center** thatâ€™s most convenient for your location and schedule.
