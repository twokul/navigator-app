title: Advanced Standing Program (ASP)
description: Earning a DDS/DMD degree (pre-doctoral programs)
---

This is the most commonly taken route by most foreign-trained dentists. To earn
a DDS/DMD degree in the US, international dentists have two options: to join an
**advanced standing program (ASP)** or a traditional DDS program (graduate
school). The latter means they will have to start at year 1 with the rest of the
incoming American dental students and complete the entire dental school program
(usually four years.)

Some schools offer special programs **(ASP)** for foreign-trained dentists.
Advanced standing programs (ASP) allow you, with your foreign degree, to skip
the first 3-4 years of undergraduate college and the first year or two of dental
school. You can then join for the final two (or three at some schools) years of
dental school, complete the program successfully, and earn your degree.
The **advanced standing program for foreign-trained dentists** is a bridge
course making an international dentist equivalent to any US-trained dentist.
This option would give you an American Dental degree (DDS/DMD)and allow you to
practice **anywhere in the U.S.A**. This is **the only option** for a
foreign-trained dentist to obtain a practicing **license in any state**.

Entry requirements include passing scores on the Integrated National Board
Dental Examination (INBDE) and the Test of English as a Foreign Language
(TOEFL), graduation from a foreign dental school, and prior transcripts. Several
advanced standing programs also require applicants undergo a psychomotor bench
test, case presentations, and a formal interview as part of the application
process.
