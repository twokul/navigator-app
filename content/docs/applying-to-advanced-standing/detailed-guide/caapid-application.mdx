title: Step 7. Apply to Universities for DDS/ DMD through the CAAPID application
---

The next step is to complete the Centralized Application for Advanced Placement
for International Dentists (CAAPID). You can find detailed information about the
process in the official [CAAPID Applicant Quick
Guide](https://www.adea.org/uploadedFiles/ADEA/Content_Conversion_Final/dental_education_pathways/CAAPID/ADEA_CAAPID-ApplicantQuickGuide-05.pdf).
Also make sure to read on, there will be more detailed information about CAAPID.

## CAAPID Application Timeline

The CAAPID application cycle typically runs **from March to February**, but
individual schools have different deadlines and requirements. By now, you should
already have a list of the schools you plan to apply to. If not, you can explore
programs participating in the Advanced Standing pathway using the official
CAAPID [program finder](https://programs.adea.org/CAAPID).

A few schools **do not** use CAAPID and require direct applications. However,
most universities offering international dental programs can be applied to
through the CAAPID portal.

## Before Starting Your Application

Before the new application cycle opens in **March**, you can create a CAAPID
account to explore the system and prepare the necessary documents. The official
[application
instructions](https://help.liaisonedu.com/ADEA_CAAPID_Applicant_Help_Center)
provide detailed instructions and a step-by-step guide on what to expect in each
section, helping you prepare well in advance.

I **strongly recommend** reviewing them before the cycle opens to avoid
last-minute confusion. However, I **do not** recommend **filling out** the
application **before the new cycle starts**, as some information **will not
transfer** to the new cycle, requiring you to enter it again. Instead, use this
time to **familiarize yourself with the system** and gather all required
documents.
