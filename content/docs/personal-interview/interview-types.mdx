description: A guide to the three main types of dental school interviews‚Äîopen, closed, and semi-closed‚Äîso you can prepare effectively
---

Each dental school conducts interviews differently, so it‚Äôs important to know
what type to expect before your interview day. The best way to confirm is by
**emailing or calling the school directly**. Below are the most common interview
formats you‚Äôll encounter.

- **Open File:** The interviewer has full access to your application, including
  GPA, test scores, and experiences.
- **Closed File:** The interviewer has **no access** to your application and
  relies entirely on your responses.
- **Semi-Closed File:** The interviewer can view some parts of your application,
  such as your experiences and personal statement, but not your academic
  records.
