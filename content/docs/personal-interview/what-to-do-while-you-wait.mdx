subtitle: How to Stay Proactive and Strengthen Your Application While Waiting for Interviews
---

Not every applicant receives interview invitations at the same timeâ€”some get
multiple offers early, while others wait longer. This variation depends on key
factors such as:

- **Application strength** (GPA, INBDE, TOEFL)
- **Clinical and work experience** (both U.S. and international)
- **Extracurricular involvement and achievements**
- **Quality of personal statement and recommendation letters**

Because the process is **highly competitive**, staying **active and strategic**
while waiting can make a meaningful difference in your results.

### How to Strengthen Your Profile While Waiting

#### Improve Your Communication and Presentation Skills

- Interviewers assess **fluency, clarity, and confidence** in English.
- Practice speaking **professionally, naturally, and persuasively**.
- Conduct **mock interviews** with mentors or peers to refine delivery.

#### Keep Updating Your CAAPID Application

- You can continue to **add new experiences, licenses, and achievements** even
  after submitting your application.
- Schools are notified of these updatesâ€”this can **increase visibility** and
  show your ongoing **professional growth**.

<Aside>
  ðŸ’¡ **Pro Tip:** If you havenâ€™t received an interview invitation by **November**, send schools an
  **update letter** highlighting your recent experiences and reaffirming your strong interest in
  their program. This also applies **after an interview**â€”schools value continued engagement and
  growth.

#### Example

After submitting my CAAPID application in **March**, I earned my **Registered
Dental Assistant (RDA) license** and was invited to **speak at a U.S.
conference**. I uploaded these updates to CAAPID, and they helped **draw more
attention to my profile**, demonstrating my commitment and initiative.

#### Prepare for Bench Tests (If Applicable)

- Some schools include a **bench test** as part of their assessment to evaluate
  clinical skills.
- Review and practice **crown and cavity preparations, wax-ups, and restorative
  procedures** to stay ready.

#### Familiarize Yourself with Different Interview Formats

Each school may use a unique style. Understanding the format helps you prepare
strategically:

- **Traditional (1:1) Interview** â€“ A personal conversation with one faculty
  member.
- **Panel Interview** â€“ Multiple interviewers evaluate you together.
- **Multiple Mini Interview (MMI)** â€“ Short, timed stations testing your
  communication and ethical reasoning.
- **Problem-Based Learning (PBL)** â€“ A group discussion on solving a **clinical
  case** collaboratively.

#### Maintain Confidence and Perspective

- Confidence greatly affects how you present yourself.
- Even if interviews take time to arrive, remember that **schools review
  applications in waves**â€”patience and persistence matter.
