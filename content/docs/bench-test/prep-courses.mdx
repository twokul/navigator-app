## My Personal Experience

I chose **self-study** for my bench test preparation because I was confident in my existing clinical skills. My focus was on learning **school-specific criteria**, mastering **prep measurements**, and maintaining **consistency under time pressure**.

Dr. Stevenson’s videos provided everything I needed for restorative practice, and I used additional resources for **wax carving**. You’ll find those links later in this guide.

Ultimately, the choice between self-study and formal instruction depends on **your learning style**. If you thrive with independence and discipline, self-study may work perfectly. But if structured guidance helps you stay focused, a **bench prep course** could be a worthwhile investment.
