title: Steps to Ensure Your Letters Are Submitted on Time
description: A step-by-step guide to help you plan, request, and follow up on your dental school recommendation letters for timely and successful submission
---

Getting strong recommendation letters isn’t just about **who writes them**, but
also **how and when they’re submitted**. Follow these six steps to ensure your
letters are completed on time and reflect your best qualities.

---

### Step 1: Choose & Contact Your Recommenders Early

- Start reaching out **3–4 months before** the CAAPID portal opens.
- Give your recommenders enough time to write a thoughtful and detailed letter.

---

### Step 2: Make the Request Professionally

- Politely reach out and remind them **how they know you**  
  _(e.g., “I was in your Organic Chemistry class and worked on your research
  project.”)_
- Clearly mention the **submission deadline** in your request.

---

### Step 3: Provide Supporting Documents

Help your recommenders write a **specific and strong** letter by sharing:

- **Your CV or résumé**
- **Your personal statement**
- **A list of achievements, extracurriculars, and relevant experiences**

**Example:** If you volunteered at a dental clinic, remind them of specific moments that
demonstrate your passion and professionalism.

### Step 4: Explain the Submission Process

- If your recommender is unfamiliar with CAAPID or [Liaison
  Letters](https://help.liaisonedu.com/Liaison_Letters_Help_Center), provide
  **clear submission instructions**.
- Offer to assist them if they encounter technical difficulties.

---

### Step 5: Send a Reminder Before the Deadline

- **One to two weeks before** the deadline, send a short **reminder email** and
  thank them in advance.
- This helps ensure your letters are submitted on time.

---

### Step 6: Follow Up with Gratitude

- Once the letter is submitted, send a **thank-you email** expressing your
  appreciation.
- If appropriate, consider a small gesture of thanks, like a coffee gift card.

### Additional Tips

Some schools allow you to upload **additional LORs** or email them directly. The
full application process—from submission to interviews—can take **6+ months**.
This gives you time to gain more experiences and request **extra letters** if a
new recommender can add value to your profile.
