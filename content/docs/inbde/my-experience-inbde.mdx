title: My Experience with INBDE Preparation
description: My experience with INBDE preparation
---

I took the INBDE in 2021 when it was first introduced. This was the inaugural
cycle for the INBDE after the discontinuation of NBDE Parts 1 and 2, so study
resources were limited. In fact, many of today's resources didn't exist then. I
discovered the TSB course through a Facebook group and enrolled to prepare for
my exam. TSB provided excellent support and helped me pass the exam on my first
attempt.

Since then, TSB may have made significant changes to their program. The best way
to get current information is to read recent reviews on Google from other
test-takers.

If I were taking the INBDE today, I'd choose either the Bootcamp or the INBDE
Booster as my primary preparation source. They appear more organized and
structured, with up-to-date information. I'm also a big fan of Dr. Ryan's
YouTube videos, which greatly assisted my preparation. His videos explain
concepts clearly and concisely, offering a good preview of what to expect from
the course.

This is just my opinion. Please be sure to conduct your own research.

In addition to the main course, I recommend using Dental Decks as a supplemental
learning resource. Google and ChatGPT is also helpful for quickly finding
answers to specific questions, though Chat GPT can make mistakes.

If you're a student who struggles to focus on preparation alone and needs a
study buddy, the best way to find one is through Facebook groups and
Telegram/WhatsApp study chats. Students in these groups actively share
information and discuss various cases.
