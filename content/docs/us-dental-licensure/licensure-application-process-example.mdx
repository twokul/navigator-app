title: Licensure Application Process Example
description: Overview of the licensure process in the state of New Jersey
---

Let me briefly introduce you the general licensure process and an example of the
requirements.

Applying for license is the very last step of the long process that includes
getting relevant education, graduating, passing exams and more. I wanted to
start from the end to show how getting the actual license may look like and then
get into the longest part.

Let’s look at the example of getting a license in the state of New Jersey. Each
state has their own requirements which may differ from the example. But
remember, the gist is the same, the only differences might be in the details
(like the type of clinical exam, we'll talk more on that later).

Here's a screenshot of the official dental board website page with the
application process requirements for licensure in NJ:

Step by step:

1. Fill out an application and send it with a check for $125. Applications are
   found on the board's website, I'll leave a link → [Application
   Form](https://www.njconsumeraffairs.gov/den/Applications/Application-for-a-Dental-License.pdf)
2. Send the necessary documents. This step is the most important and the
   longest. I'll talk about it in more detail below.
3. Receive instructions for fingerprinting.
4. Actually schedule and undergo fingerprinting, after which the prints are sent
   for a criminal background check to the FBI and directly to the commission, which
   then sends back the results.
5. Undergo orientation (basically pass an exam on the laws and code of conduct
   specific to the state where you're getting licensed). It mainly covers how to
   renew your license, how to undergo continuing education (CE courses),
   regulations on advertising yourself and your office, etc. Here’s the link to it
   → [NJ Code of
   conduct](https://www.njconsumeraffairs.gov/regulations/Chapter-30-New-Jersey-Board-of-Dentistry.pdf)
6. Send the necessary documents (if needed, the board itself contacts the
   applicant and asks for missing information).
7. If everything goes smoothly, the board sends a payment form to fill out and
   complete the payment for the 2-year license. In New Jersey, the license is valid
   for 2 years after which it must be renewed.

Above is an overview of the general application process for the **license itself**
which slightly varies from state to state.

Now let's discuss the longest and the most challenging step: what is actually
needed to get that dental license.
