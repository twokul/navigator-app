Integrated National Board Dental Examination, or the INBDE, is a test designed
to integrate the biomedical, clinical, and behavioral sciences and evaluate the
dental cognitive skills of international candidates seeking to earn admission
into advanced standing programs in the US dental schools. The INBDE became
effective on August 1, 2020. It’s the same test that international dentists gave
earlier in 2 parts: the NBDE 1 and the NBDE 2. Now they are taken collectively
and are called the INBDE instead.

The INBDE is designed to be scored as a **pass or fail** test, and candidates do not
provide numerical scores. Though scores are not given, the exam’s attempt is
counted and appears in the final report. It is always better to pass these
competitive exams on the first attempt, as candidates with multiple attempts
will be at a disadvantage when applying to competitive schools.

All you need to know about INBDE (exam content, scoring, preparation materials,
fees, retesting policy and much more) is on [JCNDE's INBDE
page](https://jcnde.ada.org/inbde).

## Recent Changes to INBDE

Over the past year, the Integrated National Board Dental Examination (INBDE) has
undergone significant changes aimed at enhancing its effectiveness and fairness.

### Establishment of a New Performance Standard

In May 2024, the Joint Commission on National Dental Examinations (JCNDE)
established a new performance standard for the INBDE. This decision followed a
structured and rigorous process involving a panel of subject matter experts who
thoroughly reviewed INBDE content to determine the level of performance required
for safe practice. The implementation of this new standard is set to occur as
soon as logistically feasible.

### Strengthening Examination Fairness

The JCNDE has also taken steps to enhance the fairness of the INBDE. In 2024,
they formally adopted a Fairness and Sensitivity Review process, which was
successfully piloted in 2023. This process involves a dedicated group of
reviewers who assess examination content specifically from a fairness
perspective, supplementing existing efforts by test constructors to ensure
equitable examination content.

### Strategic Roadmap for Examination Programs

To ensure continued innovation and advancement, the JCNDE refined strategic
roadmaps for its dental examination programs, including the INBDE. Key
activities outlined in the roadmap include:

- **2025**: Conducting a dental practice analysis to inform future updates to
  examination content domains.
- **2026**: Convening panels of subject matter experts to consider practice
  analysis results and recommend updates to INBDE test specifications.
- **2027**: Considering the implementation of multi-stage adaptive testing to
  shorten the examination and increase test security, while maintaining strong
  psychometric properties.

These initiatives reflect the JCNDE's commitment to maintaining the INBDE as a
valid, reliable, and fair assessment tool for dental licensure.

## How to Actually Prepare for the INBDE (Not Just Memorize It)

### Bootcamp & Booster

Don't just answer — _analyze_.

- ✔ Review every right **and wrong** answer.
- ✔ Look up unfamiliar terms.
- ✔ Understand why distractors are wrong.
- ✔ Revisit weak areas until they’re second nature.

### Cheat Sheets & Notes (find in the link to google folder below)

Use them to reinforce, not replace, learning.

- ✔ Highlight concepts you still don’t fully get.
- ✔ Rewrite tricky sections in your own words.
- ✔ Cross-check every topic with the main resources.

### Mental Dental & [Ninja Nerd Videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6QYFutt9cluQ3uSM963_KQ) ( 👈🏼 tap the link to watch)

Perfect for visual learners.

- ✔ Watch with intent — not in the background.
- ✔ Pause and research anything you don’t understand.
- ✔ Take notes and link concepts across subjects.

### [Anatomy Atlases (Especially Head & Neck)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/332100696_Head_and_Neck_Anatomy) (👈🏼 tap the link to download PDF)

Go beyond labels — learn function and clinical relevance.

- ✔ Study structures in context.
- ✔ Quiz yourself regularly.
- ✔ Use 3D apps if possible to build spatial memory.

### Practice Tests & Mistake Logs

- ✔ Save tough questions and review them deeply.
- ✔ Break down explanations and terms.
- ✔ Create a “mistake map” — and revisit it weekly.

### Final Tip

Memorizing isn't enough. Understand the _why_, the _how_, and the _what-if_.
That's how you pass — and how you become a better dentist in the process.
