Before you begin applying to schools, take some time to think about **where you
want to live and practice after graduation**. Research the **state board
requirements** for dental licensure in your preferred state and learn about the
local lifestyle, cost of living, and job opportunities.

At the end of the day, this decision is about shaping your **future career and
life**. So pause for a moment — reflect on where you see yourself living and
practicing.

Once you've done that, review the licensing requirements for your chosen states
on the [ADA Dental Licensure
Map](professional.ada.dentalLicensureMap).
