title: Maximize Your Chances
---

Your application is a documented reflection of your diverse experiences in
dentistry and beyond. It is crucial to include everything that sets you apart
and demonstrates your commitment to the field. U.S.-based experience is
particularly valuable, as schools prioritize applicants who are familiar with
the American dental system, culture, and professional standards.

If your profile lacks outstanding achievements—such as top-tier research,
extensive publications, or high-profile leadership roles—it becomes even more
important to craft a strong and cohesive application. Each year, competition
intensifies as stronger candidates apply, making it harder to stand out. That’s
why a strategic and well-rounded application is key to securing an interview and
ultimately gaining acceptance.

## How Schools Evaluate Applications

Understanding how dental schools filter applicants helps in optimizing your
strategy. The selection process typically follows these stages:

### Meeting Basic Admission Requirements

- Each school has its own set of prerequisites, but most require:
  - **A foreign dental degree (BDS, DDS, or equivalent)**
  - **INBDE (or NBDE Part 1 & 2 for older applicants)**
  - **TOEFL (with a competitive score, typically 100+)**
  - **GPA Evaluation (ECE or WES credential evaluation)**
  - **Application via CAAPID or individual school portals**

### Additional Factors That Influence Selection

Beyond minimum requirements, schools evaluate applications based on a variety of
aspects that distinguish top applicants from the rest.

## Key Factors That Impact Your Chances of Getting an Interview Invitation

Based on my personal experience and observations, the following elements
significantly affect your likelihood of being noticed and invited for an
interview:

### Timing of Application Submission

**The earlier, the better.** Many schools follow rolling admissions, meaning
seats fill up as applications are reviewed. Submitting early (ideally within the
first two weeks after applications open) increases your chances of being
reviewed before the competition intensifies.

### Academic Scores: TOEFL & GPA

- **TOEFL:** A score of **100+ is preferred**, but some top schools may expect
  105+ to stay competitive.
- **GPA:** While not always the most critical factor, a strong academic
  background with a **high ECE/WES GPA** strengthens your profile, especially when
  competing against candidates with U.S. dental degrees or those with exceptional
  research experience.

### Building a Cohesive Personal Brand

Admissions committees look for candidates who have a clear professional identity
and a well-rounded background in dentistry. To demonstrate this, your
experiences should form a **consistent narrative** that highlights your
**dedication, passion, and professional growth**.

- **Diverse Experience Matters:**
  - Clinical experience (U.S. or abroad)
  - Community service and volunteering
  - Leadership roles (academic or professional)
  - Teaching experience (mentoring or academic settings)
  - Research participation (especially with U.S. affiliations)
- All of these should align naturally to **complement your personal story** rather than appear as random, disconnected achievements.

### Strong Letters of Recommendation [(LORs)](/c/letters-of-recommendation)

- **LORs should reinforce your application with credibility.**
- Ideally, letters should **come from U.S.-based professionals** (dentists, professors, researchers, or mentors).
- The strongest recommendations **highlight different aspects of your profile** (clinical skills, leadership, research, and interpersonal abilities).
- **American-style letters** are preferred—clear, direct, and emphasizing **specific contributions** rather than general praise.
- Having a letter from someone connected to a dental school (faculty, alumni, or affiliated professional) can add weight.

### Personal Statement [(SOP)](/c/personal-statement)

- This is your chance to tie everything together and **bring your application to life**.
- A strong personal statement should:
  - Clearly explain **why you are pursuing dentistry in the U.S.**
  - Show how your background, experiences, and ambitions **align with the school’s values**.
  - Provoke interest—admissions officers should **want to meet you in person** after reading it.
  - Be **authentic, engaging, and free of generic clichés**.

  writing isn’t your strength.

### U.S. Residency Status (Green Card vs. Visa Applicants)

- While **having a Green Card or citizenship may make financial and
  documentation processes easier**, it is **not a dealbreaker** if your profile is
  strong.
- Many competitive applicants **without permanent residency** still gain
  admission by compensating with:
  - **Higher TOEFL scores**
  - **Stronger clinical/research experience**
  - **Well-rounded personal branding**
- If you are on a visa, demonstrating your **long-term commitment to practicing
  in the U.S.** can help counter any concerns admissions might have about your
  future plans.

## Strengthen Your Application

If your application doesn’t initially stand out, you can improve your chances by:

- **Gaining U.S.-based clinical experience** (observerships,
  [externships](/c/researching-schools/externships), dental assisting)
- **Building leadership experience** (community initiatives, education, social
  impact projects)
- **Improving research credentials** (collaborating with U.S. dental
  professionals or universities)
- **Crafting an exceptional personal statement that tells a compelling story**
- **Networking with dental professionals and program alumni**

By focusing on these aspects, you position yourself as a highly competitive
candidate, even in the face of growing competition.

## Beyond Minimum Requirements: What Truly Matters in Admissions Decisions

Meeting the **basic admission requirements** (TOEFL, INBDE, GPA, and other
prerequisites) is just the **first step**. However, **dental schools are not
just looking for "qualified" applicants—they are looking to build a well-rounded
class.** No one can say with absolute certainty what schools prioritize each
year because **their needs evolve based on the applicant pool, institutional
goals, and changes in the profession**.

The key takeaway? **Dental schools don’t necessarily seek the "best" individual
applicants; they seek the right balance of students who collectively represent
the school's mission.**

<Aside>Dental Schools Build a Well-Rounded Class, Not Just a List of Top Applicants</Aside>

A **strong candidate** is not just someone with high scores, impressive
research, or years of experience. Schools seek **a diverse cohort that
collectively strengthens their program**. This means they aim to include:

- **Applicants deeply committed to community service**
  - Those who have demonstrated a passion for public health, outreach programs,
    and underserved communities.
- **Candidates with a strong research background**
  - Individuals who can advance dental research, innovate, or contribute to
    academic discussions.
- **Leaders and professionals with unique perspectives**
  - People who bring entrepreneurial thinking, leadership roles, or diverse
    backgrounds that enrich the school environment.
- **Clinicians with outstanding practical experience**
  - Those who have extensive hands-on patient care experience, making them
    valuable additions to clinical learning teams.

### Why Is This Important?

A school does not want a **homogeneous class where everyone has the same skills
and experiences**. They aim for a dynamic and **balanced** group that will
enhance collaboration and foster different perspectives within the program.

This is why **you must identify your unique angle**—what makes you stand out
among similarly qualified candidates?

Ask yourself:

- **What personal or professional experiences define me?**
- **How do I align with the school’s mission?**
- **What qualities or skills do I bring that others may not?**
- **What qualities or skills do I bring that others may not?**

## Post-Submission: Your Work Is Not Over

Once your application is submitted, your journey does not stop there. Schools
want to see ongoing engagement and continuous improvement, which reflects your
commitment to lifelong learning and professional development.

### Key Steps After Submission

#### Continue Gaining Experience

- Keep volunteering, working, or engaging in new projects.
- Participate in dental conferences, community outreach, or shadowing programs.
- Take leadership roles in organizations or online communities.

#### Keep Schools Updated on Your Progress

- **Use the CAAPID portal update feature** to add new experiences.
- If you gain additional clinical, research, or leadership experience, **inform
  schools**—this could tip the scales in your favor.
- If waitlisted, sending updates about **new skills, experiences, or improved
  test scores** can increase your chances of admission.

#### Understand the Admissions Timeline

- Dental school admissions are fluid; **decisions can change throughout the
  cycle**.
- Some applicants **receive acceptances even days before classes begin** if
  spots open up.
- **Persistence matters!** Until you officially start school, you are still a
  candidate for admission.

The most successful applicants don’t just meet the minimum requirements—they
continuously build on their experiences and show how they fit within the
school’s mission. By staying proactive, engaging with new opportunities, and
updating schools about your progress, you increase your chances of standing out
and securing a spot in your dream program.
