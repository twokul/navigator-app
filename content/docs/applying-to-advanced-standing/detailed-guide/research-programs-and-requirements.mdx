title: Step 1. Research the DDS/DMD programs and the requirements
---

Researching dental schools as an international dentist who wants to pursue a
career in the U.S. involves several steps. Here's a guide on how to properly
conduct this research, the criteria to consider, the questions to ask, and some
materials to make your research easier.

## How to Research Dental Schools

Look for schools accredited by the Commission on Dental Accreditation (CODA) and
compare various programs with each other using the table below. You can search
for programs here: [Program Finder](https://programs.adea.org/CAAPID) or you can
use our convenient search tool called [Schools
Finder](/c/tools/schools-finder).

<Aside>
  Some schools are not available at the Program Finder tool above as they are not part of
  centralized application service. So you need to look for certain schools separately. You can
  access complete list of accredited dental schools at the American Dental Association (ADA)
  website: [Current list of all accredited dental schools.](https://adea.org/dentalschools/)
</Aside>

A few resources to help you find information about the acceptance rates and
other statistics of dental schools:

  School](https://www.studentdoctor.net/how-to-get-into-dental-school-2/north-american-dental-schools/)

## Dental School Research Spreadsheet

After you created a list of schools, use the spreadsheet below that I created
for you to compare various criteria that might be important to you across
different schools. It will help you organize your research and make an informed
decision.

Thoroughly research the criteria for getting into an advanced standing program,
the duration, the cost, student loan requirements, etc. This intensive program
is rigorous and challenging to get accepted into since a massive pool of
international dentists wants to pursue DMD/DDS. Weigh the pros and cons, the
chance of success and the time needed, etc. The spreadsheet below is here to
help you organize your research.

Use the following school research templates:
