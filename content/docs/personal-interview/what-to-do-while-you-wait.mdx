#### Example

After submitting my CAAPID application in **mid-March**, I continued to enhance
my profile. When I obtained my **Registered Dental Assistant (RDA) license** and
was **invited to speak at a U.S. conference**, I uploaded these achievements.
These updates **drew more attention to my application** and reinforced my
commitment to professional growth.

#### Prepare for Bench Tests (If Required)

- Some schools require a **bench test** as a **practical skill assessment** of
  your clinical abilities.
- Review **crown preparations, cavity restorations, wax-ups, and other essential
  procedures**.

#### Understand Different Interview Formats

Each school follows a different interview style. Knowing what to expect is key:

- **Traditional One-on-One (1:1) Interview** – A standard interview with a
  faculty member in-person or online.
- **Multiple Mini Interviews (MMI)** – Short, timed scenarios assessing
  communication, ethics, and decision-making skills.
- **Problem-Based Learning (PBL) Interview** – Group discussions where
  candidates collaborate on solving **a clinical case scenario**.
- **Panel Interview** – A structured interview with multiple faculty members.

#### Maintain Confidence and a Positive Mindset

- Confidence plays a **huge role** in how you present yourself.
- If you don't receive an interview invite immediately, **don't lose
  hope**—schools continue reviewing applications throughout the cycle.

### Final Strategies to Maximize Your Chances

#### Early November

Send an **experience update** to each school, regardless of whether you've
already been interviewed.

- Highlight **new achievements, volunteering, shadowing, or professional
  experiences**.
- Reiterate your interest in their program and how you continue to grow as a
  candidate.

#### January/February

If you haven't received an acceptance, send a **follow-up letter of interest**.

- Provide **another academic and experience update** (if you have performed well
  or gained new credentials).
- Reinforce your **enthusiasm for the program** and express your desire for an
  interview or acceptance.

The waiting period isn't idle time—it's an opportunity to **refine your skills,
gain more experience, and stay engaged in dentistry**. Every **small update or
proactive effort** increases your chances of getting noticed, securing an
interview, and **ultimately earning your spot in a U.S. dental program**.
