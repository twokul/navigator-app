description: Visa Requirements for international students residing outside of the U.S.
---

When I was applying to dental schools in the U.S., I already lived here and had
immigration status. Later, I received my green card — and honestly, that made my
life a lot easier. I didn’t have to think about visa applications or worry about
timelines. But I know that for most international dentists pursuing Advanced
Standing Programs, **navigating the student visa process is a critical (and
sometimes overwhelming) part of the journey**.

So, if you're currently outside the U.S. or here on a temporary visa, let me
walk you through what typically happens after you're accepted into a U.S. dental
school.

### Step 1: You'll Receive Detailed Visa Instructions from Your School

Once you’re admitted, most schools will send you an email with **step-by-step
instructions** on how to request your **Form I-20**, which you’ll need to apply
for an F-1 student visa.

Some universities have dedicated international student platforms to guide you through this — for example, **USC uses a system called Trojan International (TI)**. Through that portal, students upload personal information, financial documents, and their passport to start the I-20 process.

### Step 2: Carefully Follow the School’s Checklist

The email will often include a **checklist of documents** and instructions. Don’t skip any details — something as small as selecting the wrong degree level (choose “graduate”) or uploading the wrong format can delay your I-20.

<Aside>
  Read everything twice. Schools often process I-20s in batches, and missing one item can push your
  file back by weeks.

### Step 3: Prepare Financial Documents

Before a school can issue your I-20, you’ll need to show proof that you can afford the program. Each school will set a minimum amount — for USC’s dental program, for example, it’s **$83,445** for the year. (for 2025)

**Acceptable forms of proof might include:**

- Personal bank statements
- Family member or sponsor statements
- Bank letters or solvency certificates
- Educational loans (but apply closer to your visa appointment — loan letters can expire in 30–60 days)

### Step 4: SEVIS & I-20 Transfer (If You’re Already in the U.S.)

If you're already studying in the U.S. on an **F-1 visa**, you’ll need to
**transfer your SEVIS record** to your new school before they issue your I-20.
This is time-sensitive — SEVIS rules require that your transfer is completed
**at least 15 days before the start of classes**, or you’ll have to defer to a
later term.

Your current school will need to **release your SEVIS record**, and you’ll have
to submit a transfer request through the new school’s portal.

### Step 5: Changing Visa Status (e.g., from H-4 to F-1)

If you’re in the U.S. on another visa (like an **H-4**, for spouses/dependents), and you need to switch to an F-1, schools usually **connect you with their Office of International Services (OIS)** to help you with the change-of-status process. At USC, for instance, the OIS offers drop-in advising and support for this exact purpose.

### Step 6: I-20 Processing Timeline

After you upload everything correctly, most schools will review your documents and issue your I-20 within **5–7 business days**. These days, many universities deliver the I-20 **electronically** (like via Google Drive or a portal), so make sure you check your email regularly.

### Step 7: What’s Unique About USC’s Process?

To give you a real-world example:

- USC starts issuing I-20s for the summer term in **mid-January**.
- They request students **log into the Trojan International portal** in advance to avoid delays.
- If you're applying for a **private loan**, USC recommends waiting until **early April** because the loan approval letters usually expire quickly.

Whether you're applying from abroad or transferring from another U.S. school, **everything happens through the TI portal** — including SEVIS transfers and change-of-status coordination.

### Step 8: Quick Note on Visa Status Diversity at USC (ASP)

At USC's Advanced Standing Program, students are accepted with a **variety of statuses**:

- Some enter on **F-1 visas**
- Others are already **in the U.S. on different statuses**, like **H-4**, or hold **Green Cards**
- A small number might have changed their status just before starting the program

This diversity in background is normal and supported — the university provides specific guidance for each pathway.

### Final Thoughts: Know the Process, Stay Ahead

Every dental school handles things a bit differently, but most will give you
everything you need — **if you read the instructions carefully** and stay on top
of deadlines.

If you’re applying as an international student:

- Don’t rush your **loan applications** (timing matters)
- Keep track of **SEVIS deadlines** if transferring schools
- Ask for help early — **Designated School Officials (DSOs)** and OIS offices exist to support you

I know it can feel like a lot, but once you break it down, it’s manageable. And remember: **thousands of students go through this process successfully every year. You’ve got this.**
