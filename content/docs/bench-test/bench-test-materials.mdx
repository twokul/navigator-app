title: Essential Bench Test Materials for Foreign-Trained Dentists
description: A practical guide to affordable, high-quality materials for bench test preparation — everything you need for an efficient home setup without overspending
---

Preparing for the **bench test** can feel overwhelming, especially when it comes
to purchasing materials. This guide focuses on **essential items only**—no
unnecessary extras—so you can efficiently set up your practice station at home
without overspending.

---

### Mounting System

#### **Mounting Pole (Manikin Mount)**

A must-have for a realistic practice setup. Look for used ones on
[eBay](https://www.ebay.com/itm/313801671060) or
[AliExpress](https://www.aliexpress.us/w/wholesale-dental-mounting-pole.html?spm=a2g0o.productlist.search.0)
to save money.

#### **Typodont**

You don’t need a premium typodont—an affordable model works perfectly.

- **Recommended Model:** USA Kilgore Nissin 200/500 Dental Typodont (32 or 28 pcs)
- **Where to Buy:** [eBay](https://www.ebay.com/itm/313801671060) or [AliExpress](https://www.aliexpress.us/w/wholesale-dental-kilgore-typodont.html?spm=a2g0o.productlist.search.0)
- **Plastic Teeth:** Buy extra teeth to avoid running out mid-preparation
  - [eBay](https://www.ebay.com/itm/403937418896) or [AliExpress](https://www.aliexpress.us/w/wholesale-dental-kilgore-typodont.html?spm=a2g0o.productlist.search.0)

#### **Old Toothbrush & Wet Cloth**

Great for cleaning debris. A [dust cleaner](https://amzn.to/41HPHa6) also helps
keep your setup tidy.

### Handpiece & Motor System

There are **two main options** — **compressor-driven** and **electric motors**.

The motor listed here is **budget-friendly** and works **without a foot pedal**.
It gets the job done efficiently, and if you’re looking to invest more, there
are premium electric motor options available.

I personally found this motor more than enough for bench test practice. Although
it doesn’t blow air to clear dust, a **wet cloth or dust cleaner** does the job.
An electric handpiece also gives better **speed control**, which helps with
precision during refinement.

#### **Micromotor & Handpiece**

No need for an air compressor. Buy on
[eBay](https://www.ebay.com/itm/203115682867) or
[AliExpress](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256804428987190.html).

#### **Handpiece Oil**

Essential for maintenance. Available on
[eBay](https://www.ebay.com/itm/291892748094?_skw=Lubricant+Oil+Spray+For+Dental+Motors)
or [Amazon](https://amzn.to/4irViXE)

#### **Oil Nozzle**

For precise lubrication. Buy on [eBay](https://www.ebay.com/itm/232989904341)

<Aside>
  **Pro Tip:** The motor may heat up after long use. Use a small [air fan](https://amzn.to/4h7EpAj)
  to cool it between preps. A [nail tech dust collector](https://amzn.to/4kqCVDV) also helps manage
  debris and cooling. I later added a [floating drawer](https://amzn.to/3QKFZ0g) to organize my
  setup — a great space saver!
