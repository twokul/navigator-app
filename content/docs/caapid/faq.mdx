When completing the **CAAPID application**, applicants often have the most
**questions and confusion** in the following sections and often the answers are
outlined in the [application
instructions](https://help.liaisonedu.com/ADEA_CAAPID_Applicant_Help_Center).
Here are some:

### Letters of Recommendation (LORs)

#### How many are required?

CAAPID requires and allows only **three letters**, but some schools allow you to
upload more in the "Program Material" section in CAAPID or emailed directly to
school. (you can contact schools directly regarding this matter).

#### How do I submit them?

Letters must be submitted directly by the recommender via the CAAPID portal, not
by the applicant. Check the [application
instructions](https://help.liaisonedu.com/ADEA_CAAPID_Applicant_Help_Center)
for the guidelines.

You can learn more about how to strategically use multiple letters of recommendation (LORs) for dental school applications in our [LORs guide](/c/applying-to-advanced-standing/lor-guide).

### Transcripts & ECE Evaluation

#### Which transcript should I submit?

You must submit an **official course-by-course evaluation** from **ECE (Educational Credential Evaluators)**, not your original transcripts.

#### Where do I send it?

Transcripts must be **sent directly from ECE to CAAPID** (electronically); applicants cannot upload them manually.

#### How long does verification take?

Processing can take **weeks**, so send them as early as possible.

### INBDE & TOEFL Score Submission

#### How do I send my scores?

- **INBDE:** Sent directly from the **ADA/JCNDE** to CAAPID. (electronically)
- **TOEFL:** Sent directly from **ETS (Educational Testing Service)** to CAAPID
  using **institution code outlined in the** [application
  instructions.](https://help.liaisonedu.com/ADEA_CAAPID_Applicant_Help_Center/Sending_Your_Official_Transcripts%2C_Foreign_Evaluations%2C_and_Test_Scores_to_ADEA_CAAPID/Sending_Official_Test_Scores_to_ADEA_CAAPID)
  (electronically)

#### What TOEFL score is required?

It varies by school, but most require a **minimum of 90–100** on the iBT.

### Work Experience & Achievements Section

#### How detailed should this be?

Schools expect a **clear, structured work history** with **concise
descriptions** of duties, skills, and achievements.

#### Should I list observerships, externships, or volunteering?

Yes! All **dental-related** experiences should be included, even unpaid ones.

#### Can I include non-dental jobs?

I suggest including them if they showcase **transferable skills** (e.g.,
leadership, teamwork, research experience).

### Personal Statement

#### What should I include?

Focus on **why you want to pursue dentistry in the U.S., your career goals, and
what makes you a strong candidate**.

#### How long should it be?

**One page (5,200 character limit).**

#### Can I customize it for each school?

No, CAAPID only allows **one personal statement**, so make it strong and
relevant for all schools. Once you submit your application, the essay cannot be
edited or changed so have your draft somewhere else and then copy paste it to
CAAPID.

  requirements. You can find them in the "Program Material" section of CAAPID
  application. You can find multiple choice or open-ended questions specific to
  each program.

  you'll usually get an email from the school directly in that case.

  submitting your application**.

  requirements.
