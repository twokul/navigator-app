title: How to Strategically Use Multiple Letters of Recommendation (LORs) for Dental School Applications
---

Having multiple letters of recommendation (LORs) is an advantage, but they
should be strategically different from each other to provide a well-rounded
picture of you as an applicant. Each letter should highlight different aspects
of your abilities, experiences, and personality. Redundancy should be avoided—if
all your letters say the same thing, they lose impact.

## Diversity of Perspectives

Each recommender should **offer a unique perspective** on your skills,
character, and potential as a dentist. A strong set of LORs should include:

### A U.S. Dentist (Shadowing or Work Experience)

- **Focus on:** Clinical experience, professionalism, patient interactions, work
  ethic in a dental setting.
- **Why it matters:** Schools want to see that you understand the **U.S.
  healthcare system** and can function well in it.

### A Science Professor

- **Focus on:** Academic excellence, critical thinking, ability to learn complex
  material, problem-solving skills.
- **Why it matters:** Shows that you have the **intellectual capability** to
  handle a rigorous dental school curriculum.

### An Employer/Supervisor (Healthcare or Volunteer Work Preferred)

- **Focus on:** Work ethic, leadership, teamwork, communication,
  patient-centered care, and dedication to service.
- **Why it matters:** Demonstrates that you have strong **interpersonal skills,
  responsibility, and a commitment to patient care.**

### A Mentor/Supervisor from Extracurriculars or Leadership Roles

- **Focus on:** Leadership, initiative, community involvement, passion for
  dentistry, and ability to inspire and manage others.
- **Why it matters:** Dental schools look for students who will **become leaders
  in the profession** and give back to the community.

## Avoiding Redundancy – Make Each Letter Complementary

Each letter should focus on different aspects of your profile. If two letters
say _"Anna is responsible, hardworking, and passionate about dentistry,"_ it
doesn't add value. Instead, one should discuss clinical experiences, while
another focuses on leadership or academic excellence.

### Example of Redundancy (Weak LOR Strategy)

- **Two dentists** writing about shadowing.
- **Two science professors** repeating the same academic strengths.
- **Generalized praise** without specific stories or examples.

### Example of Complementary Letters (Strong LOR Strategy)

- **Dentist:** "Anna showed great attention to detail in clinic, effectively
  communicating with patients and assisting in procedures. She adapted quickly to
  the fast-paced environment, demonstrating both technical skills and compassion."
- **Science Professor:** "Anna was one of the top students in my anatomy class,
  excelling in critical thinking and problem-solving. Her ability to grasp complex
  medical concepts and apply them in lab work was outstanding."
- **Employer/Supervisor:** "Anna displayed strong leadership in our community
  outreach program, organizing dental health awareness events and mentoring
  volunteers. She is an excellent communicator and has a natural ability to
  connect with people."

These are shortened examples, not the full letters. The complete versions should
comfortably fit on an A4 page and contain at least 500–700 characters. Letters
that are too brief may come across as careless or lacking genuine effort, while
overly long ones may be burdensome for the admissions team to read.

## What If You Don't Have a U.S. Recommender?

If you don't have a **U.S. dentist** or other recommenders, you should still
focus on **getting letters from people who can highlight your professional
strengths. But having US experience is highly valued and will increase your
chances of getting accepted a lot! I can't emphasize this enough.**

Dental schools highly value! and **prefer** U.S.-based recommendations, but if
your foreign recommender is **highly respected** (e.g., head of a dental
department, research leader, etc.), it still adds value. In that case, I
strongly recommend that the recommender briefly introduce themselves and
highlight their credentials, achievements, and notable contributions to the
field.

If your letters are mostly from non-U.S. recommenders, consider **getting a
supplementary letter from a U.S. employer, volunteering experience, or
dental-related professional. You can find online remote opportunities that will
provide US experience. So do everything you can to get that US recommender.**

US dental schools (US system in general) are built on Recommendations. Every
structure relies on the recommendation letters especially if it comes from a
person who has any connection to their structure. By saying that I mean that if
you know what school you want to get in - do everything you can to network with
professionals there so they endorse your application and provide
recommendations. **Strong internal recommendations can override anything else in
your application.** So be mindful and prepared. Research what short term or
volunteer programs schools offer for international students and make everything
to get that opportunity. If your recommender has any prior connection to the
school—for example, if they are an alumnus of the program you're applying
to—it's a good idea to mention it in the letter. This can create a sense of
familiarity and strengthen the impact of their recommendation.
