## Hello, Future US Dentists!

Applying to U.S. dental schools can feel overwhelming — I know because I went
through it myself. The process is scattered across countless websites, forums,
and documents. It takes hours of research just to piece things together.

That’s why I created this guide: a clear, step-by-step roadmap to help you save
time, stay focused, and avoid common mistakes.

## About The Author

I'm **Anna Papian**, a foreign-trained dentist from Saint Petersburg, Russia.

When I first moved to the U.S., I had no roadmap. I had to learn everything
about the dental licensing process from scratch. Despite the challenges, I was
accepted into **three top Advanced Standing Programs** in my very first
application cycle:

- **USC**
- **NYU**
- **Rutgers**  
  (_and waitlisted at Loma Linda University_)

My journey wasn't easy — but it was possible with focus, strategy, and persistence.

## What Helped Me Stand Out

- Applied **strategically** to 7 programs (not 24)
- **TOEFL scores**: 107 and 105
- **INBDE**: passed on the first attempt
- **GPA**: 3.5 (U.S. converted)
- **6 years clinical practice** + **1 year teaching** in Russia
- U.S. **RDA license** with hands-on experience in U.S. clinics
- Led **hands-on workshops** and presented at U.S. dental events
- Leadership role at a **dental startup** in AI-driven surgical education
- **CAAPID application submitted early** (March)
- Strong **bench test skills**

## My Mission

Since then, I've helped other international dentists strengthen their
applications, refine their personal statements, and choose the right schools.

Today, I create **step-by-step resources** on **YouTube, Instagram, and through
this guide** to support dentists like you on the same journey.
