The **TOEFL (Test of English as a Foreign Language)** assesses your ability to
understand and use English in an academic setting. It’s a key requirement for
non-native English speakers applying to U.S. universities — including dental
schools — and a score of **100 or higher** is often expected by top programs.

Most U.S. dental schools accept **TOEFL scores taken within the past two years**,
but policies can vary. Some schools may:

- Accept **older TOEFL scores** under specific conditions
- Require **particular test formats** (e.g., iBT, Home Edition, or in-person tests)
- Set **minimum section scores** for reading, writing, listening, and speaking

Because these criteria differ from school to school, it’s essential to verify
the most recent admission requirements for each program directly through the
official [ADEA CAAPID directory](https://programs.adea.org/CAAPID).

> **Tip:** Even if your overall TOEFL score is strong, pay attention to
> individual section requirements. Some competitive programs may weigh them
> heavily during admissions.
