To work as a dentist in the US, you need a license. Each of the 50 states in the
USA has its own governing or regulatory body in the field of dentistry, called
the dental board. This board issues the license for professional practice. Just
google 'dental board' and the state abbreviation, and you'll land on their
website, where there's usually detailed information on how to get that coveted
license at a desired state.

At the federal level, there's the [American Dental Association
(ADA)](https://www.ada.org/), which brings together dentists and commissions
from across the country. Their website has a lot of useful information about
licenses, exams, etc.

Although the specific requirements can differ from state to state, every
candidate seeking a license to practice dentistry in the US needs to fulfill
three basic requirements:

1. **Educational Qualifications**: Prospective dentists are required to complete
   their education at a dental school accredited by the Commission on Dental
   Accreditation (CODA). For those with a dental degree from a non-CODA accredited
   institution, there's an option to enroll in advanced standing dental education
   programs. You’ll learn about them further in this guide.

<Aside>
  CODA accredited dental education program means that predoctoral and postdoctoral dental education
  programs are recognized as meeting standards set out by the [Commission on Dental Accreditation
  (CODA)](https://www.ada.org/en/coda) and are accredited in the U.S. The Commission recognizes
  these programs through a rigorous review process.

2. **Written Exam**: The Integrated National Board Dental Examination (INBDE) is
   a mandatory test for licensure candidates across all U.S. licensing
   jurisdictions. The INBDE, introduced on August 1, 2020, was created in response
   to evolving educational curriculums and teaching methodologies.
3. **Clinical Exam**: The requirements for clinical examinations vary by state.
   To determine the specific exam needed for a state of your interest, review [ADA
   Dental Boards. Dental Licensure
   map](https://www.ada.org/resources/licensure/dental-licensure-by-state-map).
   Most states rely on regional testing agencies to conduct these exams, leading to
   differences in timing and other requirements. The link above also contains the
   contact information for the dental board of each state in the USA with
   respective links to research detailed requirements by state.
