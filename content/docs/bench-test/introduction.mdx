description: A clear guide to understanding, preparing for, and passing the Bench Test—an essential step for internationally trained dentists applying to U.S. Advanced Standing Programs.

When I began my journey toward getting into a U.S. dental school through an
**Advanced Standing Program (ASP)**, I quickly realized that the **bench test
examination** would be one of the biggest challenges ahead. This test is a
crucial part of the admissions process, designed to evaluate your **clinical
skills, problem-solving abilities, and adaptability to U.S. dental standards**.

At first, the process felt overwhelming—but after going through it myself, I can
share how it works, what to expect, and how to prepare effectively.

### What Is the Bench Test?

The bench test is a **hands-on clinical examination** used to assess your
technical competence and clinical decision-making. Each dental school has its
own format, evaluation methods, and exercises, so **no two tests are exactly
alike**.

Common tasks include:

- **Cavity preparations** (Class II, Class III, etc.)
- **Crown preparations** (Full metal, PFM, all-ceramic)
- **Restorations** (Composite, amalgam)
- **Prosthodontic skills** (Wax-ups, removable prosthetics)
- **Endodontic access openings**
- **Clinical reasoning and treatment planning**

Not every school requires a bench test, but for those that do, **fees typically
range from $500 to $1,000 or more**.

### How the Bench Test Is Structured

Although each school designs its own format, most follow a similar structure.
Here’s what you can generally expect:

#### 1. Clinical Skills Assessment

This section involves performing specified dental procedures on typodont teeth
under strict time limits. You’ll be evaluated on:

- **Accuracy and precision** in tooth preparation
- **Margins, taper, and occlusal clearance**
- **Hand skills and ergonomics**
- **Proper use of instruments**

Every school uses its own grading system, but it helps to review the general
standards used in U.S. licensure exams, such as those from  
[ADEX Dental Criteria](https://adextesting.org/adex-dental/adex-dental-forms/).  
You can also review the [Preparation Guideline
Manual](/files/perio-restorative-manual.pdf) for detailed techniques.

#### 2. Case-Based Written Examination

Some schools also include a **written or case-based component**, which may test
your diagnostic and treatment planning skills. This can include:

- **Analyzing patient cases** (radiographs, charts, photographs)
- **Multiple-choice questions** on topics such as prosthodontics and radiology
- **Developing a treatment plan**
- **Documenting procedures as clinical notes**

For instance, Western University’s bench test included **30+ questions in one
hour**, covering both multiple-choice and treatment plan writing.

#### 3. Time Management and Handling Pressure

Time management is one of the toughest aspects. The exam simulates real-world
dental scenarios, where you must work quickly yet precisely under pressure.  
Developing calm focus and efficient workflows can make a major difference in
your performance.
