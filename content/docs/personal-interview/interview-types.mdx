title: Understanding Interview Types
---

Each dental school conducts interviews differently, so it's essential to know
which type of interview to expect. The best way to find out is by emailing or
calling the school directly. Below are the most common interview formats:

- **Open File:** The interviewer has full access to your application, including
  GPA, test scores, and experiences.
- **Closed File:** The interviewer has **no access** to your application and
  relies entirely on your responses.
- **Semi-Closed File:** The interviewer can see parts of your application, such
  as your experiences and personal statement, but not your academic records.

You can find more about it for different schools on this website: [What Dental
Schools Have Closed File
Interviews](https://bestaccreditedcolleges.org/articles/careers-and-education/what-dental-schools-have-closed-file-interviews.html).

Though the information is mainly for their 4-year DDS/DMD programs, it still
provides great insight to the type of the interview to expect and some other
statistics.

### Open File Interview

#### What It Is

The interviewer has your entire application in front of them—GPA, test scores,
work experience, personal statement, letters of recommendation, everything.

#### What to Expect

- They may ask specific questions about your grades, gaps, or low scores, so be
  ready to address any academic weaknesses honestly and constructively.
- They could reference specific shadowing experiences, jobs, or volunteer work,
  so know your application inside-out.
- There may be follow-ups based on your personal statement—why you said what you
  said, or what you've done since writing it.

#### How to Prepare

- Review your entire application beforehand.
- Practice explaining any red flags or inconsistencies.
- Be able to expand on each experience listed—what you learned, how it shaped you, etc.
- Prepare a few strong stories from your experiences that highlight your growth,
  leadership, communication, etc.

### Closed File Interview

#### What It Is

The interviewer knows nothing about you. No GPA, no personal statement—just your name and what you say during the interview.

#### What to Expect

- The focus is 100% on how you present yourself in person.
- You'll need to introduce yourself from scratch—your background, experiences,
  and motivation for dentistry.
- Strong communication and storytelling skills are key.

#### How to Prepare

- Have a clear and compelling introduction: who you are, where you're from, and
  why you chose dentistry.
- Be prepared to guide the interview—since they have no background, it's up to
  you to make your story shine.
- Prepare answers to common interview questions like:
  - Why dentistry?
  - What's your greatest strength?
  - Tell me about a challenge you overcame.
  - How do you handle stress?
- Practice mock interviews where the interviewer knows nothing about you.

### Semi-Closed File Interview

#### What It Is

The interviewer has partial access—typically your personal statement and
experiences, but not your GPA or test scores.

#### What to Expect

- Questions may center around your motivation and experiences, but not your
  academic performance.
- They'll often try to assess your fit with the school, values, and
  communication skills.

#### How to Prepare

- Re-read your personal statement—they'll likely ask questions based on it.
- Be ready to discuss your experience and motivation in depth.
- Have thoughtful answers prepared that demonstrate reflection, growth, and
  alignment with the program's mission.
- You still need a strong first impression, since they don’t have the full
  academic context.

### Final Tips

- Always ask ahead or research which format the school uses.
- Use the
