The **TOEFL** (Test of English as a Foreign Language) measures your ability to
use and understand English at the university level. It's often a requirement for
non-native English speakers to attend English-speaking universities, and a score
of 100+ is commonly needed for top schools.

While the majority of Dental Schools in the US accept TOEFL scores taken within
last 2 years, some have different rules and accept older scores. Also take into
consideration that each schoolâ€™s requirements on the type of the test (IBT, Home
edition, In class etc)differs. Some schools even specify what score they want
for each section of the TOEFL in their admission requirements. Make sure to
check the up-to-date admission requirements for desired schools yourself
