## Traditional Interview (1:1)

#### What It Is

A personal, one-on-one conversation with a faculty member, admissions staff, or
dentist.

#### What to Prepare

- Strong, structured answers to classic questions:
  - "Tell me about yourself"
  - "Why dentistry?"
  - "Why this school?"
- Know your story and values well - this format is more personal and reflective.
- Be conversational but professional - they're also evaluating your bedside
  manner and maturity.
- Practice maintaining eye contact, smiling naturally, and building rapport.

## Panel Interview

#### What It Is

You sit in front of 2–5 interviewers who may ask questions in turn or
collaboratively, reducing individual bias.

#### What to Prepare

- Expect different perspectives: one may focus on academics, another on
  personality or professionalism.
- Stay calm even if questions feel rapid-fire.
- Practice turning your head naturally to include each person when responding.
- Be polite and address the panel as a whole — but respond directly to whoever
  asked the question.

## Multiple Mini Interview (MMI)

#### What It Is

Timed "stations" (usually 6–8) with 1 scenario/question per station. You get a
minute or two to read the prompt and then a few minutes to respond.

#### What to Prepare

- Practice answering ethical dilemmas, teamwork scenarios, and situational
  questions.
- Use structured responses like "Intro → Options → Consequences → Choice →
  Justification".
- Stay neutral and thoughtful - they care about your reasoning, not whether you
  have the "right" answer.
- Practice speaking clearly and staying within time limits.

## Problem-Based Learning (PBL)

#### What It Is

You work in a group to analyze a clinical case. It's not about solving it
perfectly, but how you think, discuss, and collaborate.

#### What to Prepare

- Brush up on basic medical/dental terminology and systems.
- Practice thinking aloud, asking clarifying questions, suggesting tests, or
  hypothesizing.
- Show openness to others' ideas and avoid dominating the conversation.
- Demonstrate critical thinking: "If X is ruled out, maybe it's Y… but we need
  test Z to be sure."
- They're watching your communication, flexibility, problem-solving, and
  professionalism.
- The focus is on teamwork, logical reasoning, and adaptability rather than
  having the "right" answer.
- Watch the video below to understand the general principals of PBL.

## Group Interview

#### What It Is

You're interviewed with other applicants. Could include discussion, debate, or
solving a scenario as a group.

#### What to Prepare

- Practice speaking up without dominating.
- Show you can listen, collaborate, and respect other opinions.
- Demonstrate leadership through facilitation (e.g., summarizing, encouraging
  quieter members) not control.
- Be polite, confident, and positively engaging with both peers and the panel.

## Online/Video Interview

#### What It Is

Can be either:

- Pre-recorded responses to timed questions (e.g. Kira Talent), or
- Live 1:1 Zoom-style interview (like at Loma Linda or USC).

#### What to Prepare

- If pre-recorded:
  - Practice looking directly into the webcam.
  - Rehearse concise responses in 1–2 mins.
  - Test your tech, lighting, and background.
- If live:
  - Same prep as a traditional interview.
  - Bonus: Smile more, speak a bit slower (video delay), and avoid interrupting.

<Aside>
  For recorded, prepare elevator-pitch style answers and use cue cards near the camera for structure
  (not scripts!).
