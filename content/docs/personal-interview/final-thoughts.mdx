### Professionalism in Interviews

#### Dress Code

- **Men:** Opt for a **navy, black, or gray suit** paired with a **white or light blue shirt**. Avoid flashy ties or accessories.
- **Women:** Choose a **knee-length dress, skirt, or pantsuit** in **neutral tones**. Wear **closed-toe, comfortable shoes** and minimal jewelry.

#### What to Bring

- **Extra copies** of your **personal statement, resume**, and (if applicable) **application**—some schools may misplace files.
- A **notebook or padfolio** to jot down key points or reflections.
- A **printed interview confirmation email**, as some schools may request it.
- Check your school’s instructions—certain schools prefer that you **bring nothing** to the interview.

#### Booking & Scheduling Interviews

- Respond to invitations **immediately**. Some programs fill interview slots on a **first-come, first-served** basis.

#### The Night Before

- Confirm the **time, location, and any required documents**.
- Plan your **route and parking** to avoid morning stress.
- Get a **full night’s rest (at least 8 hours)** and **avoid caffeine or alcohol**.

#### Interview Day Etiquette

- Arrive **15–20 minutes early**, but don’t check in too soon.
- Be **courteous to everyone**—staff, students, and fellow candidates. Admissions committees notice professionalism beyond the interview room.
- Engage positively with **other applicants**—you might be meeting your future classmates.

#### Post-Interview Follow-Up

- Reference **specific details** from your conversation to personalize your message.

### Practical Tips

- **Practice mock interviews** with peers or mentors.
- Let your **passion for dentistry** show naturally.
- Even if you’re an experienced dentist, emphasize your **willingness to learn** and **openness to feedback**.
- Show **gratitude** toward your professors and alma mater.
- Research each school beforehand—prepare **thoughtful questions** for your interviewers.
- Be aware that some schools include a **Bench Test** (e.g., wax-ups, partial denture design, endodontic tasks) as part of the interview.
- Review the [**Interview Do’s and Don’ts (PDF)**](/files/interview-dos-donts.pdf) for a quick refresher.
- Dress **professionally and comfortably**—appearance influences first impressions.

### Final Thoughts

First impressions matter. During the interview, your **body language**
communicates as much as your words. Maintain **good posture**, **eye contact**,
and **a warm smile**. A confident handshake—initiated politely—can set a
positive tone.

Before leaving, **thank your interviewer by name** to leave a lasting
impression. Later, follow up with a **thank-you email** mentioning something
specific you appreciated about the conversation or program.

If you forget your interviewer’s name, don’t stress—contact information is often
included in your interview materials.

Remember: interviews are your opportunity to show **who you are beyond your
application**. With preparation, clarity, and confidence, you’ll stand out as a
**future dental professional ready to thrive**.
