### Professionalism in Interviews

#### Dress Code

- **Men:** Stick to **navy, black, or gray suits** with a white or light blue
  shirt. Avoid flashy colors.
- **Women:** Wear a **knee-length skirt, dress, or pantsuit**. Stick to neutral
  tones and **comfortable shoes**.

#### What to Bring

- **Copies of your personal statement and resume** (some schools might misplace
  your file). You can even bring your application.
- A **notebook or padfolio** to jot down notes.
- **Printed interview confirmation email** (some schools require it).
- Some schools ask you to not bring anything.

#### Booking & Scheduling Interviews

- Respond **ASAP** to interview invitations—some schools fill slots on a
  **first-come, first-served** basis.

#### What to Do the Night Before the Interview

- Confirm the **interview time, location, and required documents**.
- Plan your **route** and estimate travel time.
- Get a **good night’s sleep (8 hours)** and avoid excessive caffeine or alcohol.

#### Interview Day Etiquette

- Arrive **15-20 minutes early** but don’t enter too soon (some ADCOMS dislike
  this).
- Be **polite to everyone**, including staff, students, and fellow
  candidates—you never know who has influence over admissions.
- Engage with **other applicants**; they could be your future classmates!

#### Post-Interview Follow-Up

- **Send a thank-you email** to your interviewer within **24 hours**.
- Reference something specific from the conversation to **personalize** your message.
- Express your continued interest in the program.

### Practical Tips

- Do a mock interview with friends.
- Show off your passion for dentistry. Don't be afraid of showing your
  personality.
- Even though you have been a dentist for a while, show that you can still be a
  student, that you want to learn and accept criticism.
- Show that you are appreciative of your school and professors.
- Read about the school you are interviewing at. You will be asked if you have
  questions for the interviewers. Prepare questions.
- Some schools do additional activities during the interviews, such as exams,
  wax-ups, partial denture design and endodontic work. (which is a second part
  called Bench Test)
- Dress Appropriately: Wear business professional attire.

### Final Thoughts

First impressions matter, and body language plays a key role in how you’re
perceived during an interview. Project confidence by maintaining good posture,
making eye contact, and offering a firm handshake—ideally, initiate it first
with a smile and a polite greeting. Your interviewer has limited time to assess
your skills, character, and potential, so conveying the right signals early on
can help you stand out.

Equally important is remembering your interviewer's name and thanking them
personally at the end—it makes you more memorable. After the interview, send a
thank-you email to show appreciation and include a statement of what you liked
about the school and the program to reinforce your interest in the school. If
you forget their name, don’t worry—contact details are often included in your
interview package.

Interviews are your chance to showcase **who you are beyond your application**.
With thorough preparation, strong communication, and confidence, you can
**maximize your chances of acceptance** into your dream dental program!
