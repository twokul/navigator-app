title: Step 3. Obtain Your Dentpin
---

<Aside>
  If you have previously taken or applied to take any dental exam, or if you are a licensed dentist
  or dental hygienist in the U.S., you already have a Dentpin â€“ please do not register for another.
</Aside>

The first step in the application process is confirmation or assignment of your
Dentpin (unique personal identifier) on the [American Dental Association
website](http://www.ada.org/en/education-careers/dentpin).

Follow [this link](https://adadts.my.site.com/dts/s/login/SelfRegister) to register for a
DENTPIN (if you don't have it yet) and fill out all the necessary forms.
