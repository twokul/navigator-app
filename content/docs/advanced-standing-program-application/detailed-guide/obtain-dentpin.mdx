<Aside>
  If you have ever applied for or taken any dental exam in the U.S., or if you are already licensed
  as a dentist or dental hygienist, you **already have a DENTPIN**. Do not register for a new one.
</Aside>

Before starting your application process, you must confirm or obtain your
**DENTPIN** — a unique personal identifier used by the [American Dental
Association (ADA)](official.ada.dentpin) to track all
your dental examination and licensure activities.

If you do not yet have a DENTPIN, you can register for one by visiting the
[DENTPIN Registration
Portal](official.ada.dentpinRegistrationPortal) and completing the
required information.
