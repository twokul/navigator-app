## Traditional Interview (1:1)

#### What It Is

A personal, one-on-one conversation with a faculty member, admissions staff, or dentist.  
This format allows for a more personalized and reflective discussion.

#### What to Prepare

- Strong, structured answers to classic questions:
  - “Tell me about yourself.”
  - “Why dentistry?”
  - “Why this school?”
- Be ready to discuss your journey, values, and motivations.
- Maintain professionalism while being conversational—your **bedside manner and maturity** are being assessed.
- Practice **eye contact**, **natural smiling**, and **rapport-building**.

## Panel Interview

#### What It Is

You’ll face a group of 2–5 interviewers who ask questions either individually or collaboratively to minimize bias.

#### What to Prepare

- Expect varied focus areas — academics, personality, and professionalism.
- Stay calm even if the pace feels fast or intense.
- Make natural eye contact with all interviewers; respond directly to the one asking the question.
- Be **polite**, **confident**, and **inclusive** in your communication.

## Multiple Mini Interview (MMI)

#### What It Is

A series of short, timed stations (typically 6–8) where each station presents a new scenario or question.  
You’ll have about a minute to read the prompt and a few minutes to respond.

#### What to Prepare

- Practice **ethical dilemmas**, **teamwork**, and **situational** questions.
- Use structured responses like:  
  **Intro → Options → Consequences → Choice → Justification**
- Stay **calm, balanced, and reflective** — they assess your reasoning process, not the “right” answer.
- Practice concise, clear communication within time limits.

## Problem-Based Learning (PBL)

#### What It Is

A group exercise where you collaboratively analyze and discuss a clinical case.  
The goal is not a perfect diagnosis but to demonstrate **critical thinking**, **communication**, and **teamwork**.

#### What to Prepare

- Review basic **medical/dental terminology** and **systemic reasoning**.
- Think aloud, ask clarifying questions, and propose hypotheses.
- Show openness and adaptability—avoid dominating.
- Example reasoning:  
  _“If X is ruled out, perhaps Y fits better, but we’d need test Z to confirm.”_
- The focus is on **how** you think, collaborate, and communicate, not the final answer.

## Group Interview

#### What It Is

You’ll be interviewed alongside other applicants.  
Activities may include group discussions, debates, or collaborative problem-solving.

#### What to Prepare

- Practice **speaking confidently** without dominating.
- Show **teamwork**, **listening**, and **respect** for others’ opinions.
- Demonstrate leadership by facilitating discussion (e.g., summarizing points or encouraging quieter members).
- Be polite, composed, and positively engaged throughout.

## Online or Video Interview

#### What It Is

This can be either:

- **Pre-recorded** responses to timed questions (e.g., _Kira Talent_), or
- **Live virtual** interviews via Zoom (e.g., _Loma Linda_, _USC_).

#### What to Prepare

**If pre-recorded:**

- Practice looking directly into the webcam.
- Rehearse concise 1–2 minute responses.
- Test your **tech setup**, **lighting**, and **background**.

**If live:**

- Prepare as for a traditional interview.
- Smile more often, speak slightly slower, and avoid interrupting due to lag.

<Aside>
  💡 **Pro tip:** For recorded formats, use brief cue cards near your camera for structure (not full
  scripts!). Think elevator-pitch style — clear, confident, and engaging.
