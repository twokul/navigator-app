Submitting your **CAAPID application early** significantly increases your
chances of receiving **multiple interview invitations**. The first round of
interview invites typically starts around **late June**, but the timeline varies
greatly between schools.

- Some schools **begin sending invitations in October**, so don't panic if you
  haven't received an invite early in the cycle.
- The **interview cycle generally lasts until April**, but certain schools may
  complete their process **by December 1** and stop inviting candidates
  thereafter.
- You can track interview invites for specific schools by checking the [Student
  Doctor Network (SDN)
  Forums](https://forums.studentdoctor.net/categories/dental-communities-dds-and-dmd.55/)
  and the [Facebook
  Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/caapid/?ref=share&mibextid=wwXIfr&rdid=hlN6PUekgkJjf5Rf&share_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fshare%2Fg%2F15qJUXk57Y%2F%3Fmibextid%3DwwXIfr#),
  where applicants share updates about their interview notifications.
