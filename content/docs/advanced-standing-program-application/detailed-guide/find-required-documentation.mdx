title: Step 2. Find Required Documentation and Order ECE Evaluation Reports
---

<Aside>
  As you already know one of the requirements to applying to Advanced Standing program or any other
  ADA accredited dental school programs you need to pass INBDE. In order to schedule and take INBDE
  exam you need to go through a few preparation steps which include Evaluating your credentials and
  Obtaining your Unique Dental Number (dentpin), which we'll discuss further.
</Aside>

A **credential evaluation** compares academic and professional degrees earned in
one country to academic and professional degrees earned in another country.
Colleges use credential evaluations to evaluate foreign education according to
US standards as part of the admission process.

The majority of the dental schools ask applicant to prepare evaluation with the
ECE company. However, some schools do not accept ECE report and ask for
evaluations made by WES company. This time you will need to open your Research
Spreadsheet and find the requirements for the specific schools you are applying
to.

Applicants need to get a **course-by-course** report from
[ECE](https://www.ece.org/) for being eligible to schedule and take the
Integrated National Board examination - this is enough for this step. Another
type of evaluation is the [World Education Services (WES)](https://www.wes.org/)
evaluation (not required to take INBDE, but some schools require WES as part of
their admissions process; it means if you got an ECE evaluation you may also
need to get WES evaluation for specific schools that accept only WES. Again make
sure to check your desired schools' requirements for accurate information).

## ECE Evaluation

Since the majority of dental schools accept ECE evaluation, I will cover it in
more details here. With WES the process is straightforward, just follow the
guidelines on their website.

Educational Credential Evaluators, Inc. (ECE) is a private, non-profit
organization that prepares evaluation reports identifying the United States
equivalents of educational qualifications earned in other countries.

ECE evaluation costs **$195 (valid for 2024).** The price depends on the
amount of evaluation copies you order.

## How to order your evaluations?

Follow these steps:

1. Go to [ECE website]({{official.ece}}/US-Institutions)
2. Choose **Course by Course evaluation** type.
3. Review [required
   documents]({{official.ece}}/Documentation-Requirements)
   for your country
   - In the drop down menu choose the country where you studied to find the list
     of documents and requirements for your evaluations.
   - For degrees obtained in the United States, you do not need an ECE
     evaluation. The respective application portal has guidelines on how to
     send/upload transcripts.
   - [Example of the required documents for
     Russia](https://accounts.ece.org/DocumentRequirement/167).
4. Get the required documents ready:
   - Prepare English translations for all documents issued in a foreign
     language. You need complete, literal, word-for-word translations, and in the
     same format as the original document. I used [Rush Translate
     Services.](https://rushtranslate.com/certified-translation?ref=dentists-abroad)
     They are certified, user-friendly, accessible online and prepare the
     translations in a timely manner.
   - If additional document preparation is required for your specific country of
     graduation, follow the guidelines on the ECE website to prepare all the
     necessary documents.
   - Translations can be submitted to ECE by mail with the rest of your
     documents or email (where and how to submit your documents will be clearly
     explained at the last step of your ECE application before submitting the
     payment).
5. Order a report (step 3 on the [ECE website]({{official.ece}}/US-Institutions)):
   - Create an account with ECE.
   - Complete the application and submit payment through your account. Applicant
     should **request an electronic copy of the ECE report to be sent to JCNDE**
     from the drop down menu when choosing recipients. This is important
     **to be able to schedule your INBDE exam.** You may want to order
     additional copy for yourself to see the evaluation report. I donâ€™t recommend
     you ordering more copies for schools at this time. You can do it later when
     working on your CAAPID application.
   - After placing an order, follow the guidelines provided by the ECE and mail
     or submit your educational documents **according to your documentation
     requirements**.
   - Here is a [sample ECE evaluation
     report](https://www.ece.org/ECE-FIles/Sample-Reports/Sample_CBC_Report.pdf).

## Important Notes

Usually ECE requires applicants to mail their documents if not requested them
any other way (follow the guidelines sent to you by ECE). When mailing your
documents keep in mind the following:

- You Should mail **Original Documents** to ECE. NOT Photocopies, notarized
  copies, faxes, or scans - these are NOT considered original documents. Only
  original documents must be mailed.
- **Original documents sent by the applicant will be returned with the completed
  evaluation report**. Once ECE completes your evaluation report it will mail you
  back your documents with the evaluations. It will also send your electronic
  reports to the recipients you chose when ordering your report (JCNDE).
- Once JCNDE (ADA) receives the ECE evaluation, they send you a confirmation
  email and you will be eligible to register and take the INBDE exam. While you
  wait for your evaluation reports follow and complete the next step below -
  obtain your Dentpin.
