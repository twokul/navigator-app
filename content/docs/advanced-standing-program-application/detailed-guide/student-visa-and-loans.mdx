title: Step 9. Wait for Acceptance to Program and Apply For Student Visa (if not a citizen or Green card holder)/ Manage Student Loans

Unfortunately, the paperwork is not over with an acceptance letter. Visa
applications, bank loans, background checks are started at this stage.

## Student Visa

Go to your country's U.S. embassy website or to the website of the U.S. embassy,
where you will have your visa interview. Read about the student visa and the
papers they require. The following requirements are common among different
embassies and recommendations based on personal experiences, so please be
advised they may vary between embassies.

Apply for a [student
visa](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/study/student-visa.html)
when the school issues you a Form I-20 (Certificate of Eligibility for
Nonimmigrant [F-1] Student Status). You must have a copy of the I-20 when you
make an appointment with the embassy.

Pay your Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) fee to U.S.
Homeland Security. You will need this receipt when you go for your visa
interview. In your interview, be prepared to share how you will be managing
finances and living expenses for school.

Be prepared to answer the following questions (be honest and provide concise
answers):

1. Why did you choose to get your education in the U.S.?
2. Why do you want to attend this school? Show that you understand what
   education you are going to get, the advantages of being a U.S.- trained dentist
   and the great school where you were accepted.
3. Show me the funding—this might be the most important question during the
   entire interview. You have to show that you have the money to cover the
   program's costs. Real estate, investments and stocks are irrelevant. If your
   parents or a family member are sponsoring you, they will need to sign a letter
   of sponsorship with their current balance and the amount they are willing to
   sponsor you with.
4. What are your plans after you graduate? Be prepared to answer this question.

## Loans

If you are planning to take loans, private loans are an option. A co-signer who
is an American citizen (permanent citizen or green card holder) is typically
required. If you have a green card or citizenship, you will be eligible for
federal loans and financial aid. You can't arrive in the United States earlier
than 30 days before the start date of your program.

## Relocation

The school's international student office should be able to help you find the
best location to live that is easily accessible to the school. If your school
offers university housing, this is usually a reliable and reasonably priced
option. Apply as early as possible for university apartments.
