Preparing for the bench test can be overwhelming, especially when it comes to
purchasing materials. This guide will help you focus on essential items only—no
unnecessary expenses, just what you need to efficiently practice at home.

### Mounting System

#### Mounting Pole (Manikin Mount)

A must-have for a realistic setup. Look for used ones on
[eBay](https://www.ebay.com/itm/313801671060) or find one on
[Aliexpress](https://www.aliexpress.us/w/wholesale-dental-mounting-pole.html?spm=a2g0o.productlist.search.0)
to save money.

#### Typodont

The most affordable option will work. You don't need a premium one.

- **Recommended Model:** USA Kilgore Nissin 200/500 Dental Typodont (32 or 28
  pcs).
- **Where to Buy:** [eBay](https://www.ebay.com/itm/313801671060) or [Aliexpress](https://www.aliexpress.us/w/wholesale-dental-kilgore-typodont.html?spm=a2g0o.productlist.search.0)\*\*
- **Plastic Teeth:** Buy extra teeth to avoid running out mid-preparation.
- **Where to Buy:** [eBay](https://www.ebay.com/itm/403937418896) or [aliexpress](https://www.aliexpress.us/w/wholesale-dental-kilgore-typodont.html?spm=a2g0o.productlist.search.0)\*\*

#### Old Toothbrush & Wet Cloth

Useful for cleaning dust during preparation. I used this [dust
cleaner](https://amzn.to/41HPHa6) which was super helpful.

### Handpiece & Motor System

There are **pros and cons** to both **compressor-driven** and **electric
motors**. The **motor listed in the guide** is a **budget-friendly option**—it
doesn’t allow for a **foot pedal attachment**, but the most important part is
that **it gets the job done**. If you’re looking to **invest more**, there are
**higher-end electric motor options** available on the market.

Personally, I found this **motor to be sufficient** for bench test prep. Unlike
an air-driven handpiece, you **won’t have air to clear the dust**, but a **wet
cloth or dust cleaner works just fine** for wiping off debris. One of the main
reasons I **prefer an electric handpiece** is the ability to **control the
speed**, which can be a huge advantage when refining preps. **Overall, I think
this is a great, practical choice for bench test preparation!**

#### Micromotor & Handpiece

No need for an air compressor. You can buy it on
[eBay](https://www.ebay.com/itm/203115682867) or
[aliexpress](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256804428987190.html?spm=a2g0o.productlist.main.47.16595c4eO1vT40&aem_p4p_detail=202503041333383489119479753760001466628&algo_pvid=010956f4-4af5-47cf-a83f-ce2cea2f36bf&algo_exp_id=010956f4-4af5-47cf-a83f-ce2cea2f36bf-23&pdp_ext_f=%7B%22order%22%3A%2213%22%2C%22eval%22%3A%221%22%7D&pdp_npi=4%40dis%21USD%2173.38%2161.49%21%21%2173.38%2161.49%21%40%2112000030744770591%21sea%21US%210%21ABX&curPageLogUid=6piU9PPFdMje&utparam-url=scene%3Asearch%7Cquery_from%3A&search_p4p_id=202503041333383489119479753760001466628_6)

#### Handpiece Oil

Essential for maintenance. You can buy it on
[eBay](https://www.ebay.com/itm/291892748094?_skw=Lubricant+Oil+Spray+For+Dental+Motors&epid=561780083&itmmeta=01JNHHGFB43P2WHC8WFGZBR8QY&hash=item43f629df3e:g:wPYAAOSwBydbfvR8&itmprp=enc%3AAQAKAAABAFkggFvd1GGDu0w3yXCmi1d7TrKPXzp1aVTHWD8xv2%2BscLwFgkAAfq%2BKRAnaikTq1boMCiNmpbKmAcRTNNi0JDMUxcDTt4KMgzZXTDxgvAO%2BXOy7ZOk35flxBEOOZm4YLHY8wrEphB4c00mFixsEiMA%2Fm3feP%2B1WuIB15686sVPgbPHNf5KFF5uTwaeDvGiat6nggr35fe2KlW3u6cHAvC3%2Bnlx8Q1udhL4QJIJgWhXVgko3HPQwbFL1HKcRZKBkVrmxcYpteA35whNtrLge9VGksGfvinqwDb5%2FeHYp1h02L3VA3oSGki%2FvD%2FIRxdh5imtx1%2Btl2rjN4z0OpGjxr4A%3D%7Ctkp%3ABFBM6PXBsaxl)
or [amazon](https://amzn.to/4irViXE)

#### Nozzle For Oil

Helps with proper oil application. You can buy it on
[eBay](https://www.ebay.com/itm/232989904341).

<Aside>
  One note: the motor does tend to get hot after continuous use. One trick that helped me was
  **using a small [air vent/fan](https://amzn.to/4h7EpAj)**. Whenever I had to pause my prep, I
  placed my handpiece right next to the fan to let it cool down. This made a big difference in
  preventing overheating and helped me keep a steady workflow without long breaks. Another useful
  tool I found later was a [nail tech dust collector](https://amzn.to/4kqCVDV). Not only does it
  collect debris efficiently, but it also provides some cooling effect for the handpiece. I managed
  to place it on my lap while prepping the teeth and later I found a great [floating
  drawer](https://amzn.to/3QKFZ0g) I attached to the table and placed the nail duster there along
  with all my instruments. If you're struggling with heat buildup, these two solutions can make your
  practice sessions much smoother!

### Essential Instruments

These are the only instruments you need for preparation. No extras!

#### Dental Mirror

Where to Buy: [Amazon](https://amzn.to/3EYy0dd)

#### Explorer Probe with color coded marking

Helps with measuring and detecting margins. Where to Buy:

One hatchet is enough. Buy the cheapest hatchet and a sharpening stone as
hatchets get dull pretty soon. Where to Buy: [Amazon](https://amzn.to/41pLW7R).

#### Sharpening Stone

Used to maintain your enamel hatchet's sharpness. Where to Buy:
[Amazon](https://amzn.to/4bquKDM).

#### RGS 3-4 Measuring Instrument

Some people consider this unnecessary. If you don't want to buy it, you can use
a burnisher or plugger instead. I did not use this instrument. I used the probe
with markings for measuring. Where to Buy: [Stevenson Dental
Solutions](https://stevensondentalsolutions.com/shop/rgs-3-4/).
