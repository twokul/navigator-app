description: Common questions about the CAAPID application process for internationally trained dentists â€” including LORs, transcripts, test scores, and personal statements
---

When completing the **CAAPID application**, many applicants encounter confusion
in a few key sections. Most answers can be found in the official [application
instructions](official.adea.caapidApplicantHelpCenter),
but hereâ€™s a simplified breakdown.

---

### Letters of Recommendation (LORs)

#### How many are required?

CAAPID requires and allows **three letters**, but some schools accept additional
letters via the **Program Materials** section in CAAPID or by direct email.
(Contact each school to confirm.)

#### How are they submitted?

Letters must be submitted **directly by the recommender** through the CAAPID
portal â€” not by the applicant. Review the [official submission
guidelines](official.adea.caapidApplicantHelpCenter) for
details.

Learn how to use LORs strategically in our [LORs Guide](/c/letters-of-recommendation/introduction).

### ðŸ“„ Transcripts & ECE Evaluation

#### Which transcript should I submit?

Submit an **official course-by-course evaluation** from **ECE (Educational
Credential Evaluators)** â€” not your original transcripts.

ECE sends transcripts **electronically and directly** to CAAPID; applicants
cannot upload them manually.

Verification may take **several weeks**, so submit early.

### INBDE & TOEFL Score Submission

- **INBDE:** Sent directly from **ADA/JCNDE** to CAAPID (electronically).

  **institution code** listed in the [official
  instructions](official.caapidTestScores).
