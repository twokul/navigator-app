---

## U.S. Experience Matters — Even a Little Goes a Long Way

For internationally trained dentists, **any U.S. dental-related experience** adds significant value to your application—whether you’re a recent graduate or an experienced practitioner abroad.

Having U.S. exposure shows **adaptability**, **initiative**, and **genuine interest in the American healthcare system**. Even a few months of experience can help your application stand out.

## Practical Ways to Gain U.S. Dental Experience

### Clinical & Academic Involvement

- **Shadow U.S.-licensed dentists** in private practices or dental schools.
- **Volunteer** at community clinics, non-profit organizations, or healthcare centers.
- **Work as a dental assistant** (on-the-job training or certified roles).
- **Apply for dental hygiene licensure** (Florida offers a pathway for international dentists with INBDE). Learn more [here.](/c/related-paths-and-resources/become-dental-hygienist-as-asp-applicant)
- **Join observer programs** at dental schools or hospitals.
- **Pursue a Master’s degree** in public health or healthcare management with a dental focus.

### Related Experiences That Also Strengthen Your Profile

- **Dental Startups:** Contribute to operations, content creation, research, or marketing in dental or health-tech startups. This demonstrates versatility and U.S. work exposure.
- **Dental Lab Work:** Showcases **manual dexterity** and **attention to detail**—skills admissions committees highly value.
- **Community Volunteering:** Especially in underserved areas or clinics connected to dental schools.

<Aside>
  If you’re already in the U.S. for your INBDE exam, consider extending your stay to gain additional
  clinical exposure through shadowing or volunteering nearby.

## Strategic Tips to Build a Stronger Profile

### Volunteer Where You Hope to Study

If you’re targeting a particular school, **volunteer or shadow there** when possible. If you don’t have direct contacts, message **current students** via Instagram, LinkedIn, or student forums for advice or introductions.

<Aside>Networking often opens doors to opportunities not listed publicly.</Aside>

### How Much Experience Is Enough?

There’s no fixed requirement, but many successful applicants report at least **100 hours of consistent volunteering in one location** (for example, 4 hours per week for 6 months). This shows dedication and helps you earn **meaningful recommendations**.

<Aside>Long-term involvement at one site is more valuable than many short-term experiences.</Aside>

### Choose Experiences That Add Purpose

Focus on activities that strengthen weaker areas in your profile:

| Profile Gap           | Recommended Experience                      |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Limited U.S. exposure | Volunteer in clinics, startups, or schools  |
| Limited hand skills   | Dental tech or lab work                     |
| Few professional ties | Network at events or with dental students   |
| Limited leadership    | Organize dental clubs or online initiatives |
