Integrated National Board Dental Examination, or the INBDE, is a test designed
to integrate the biomedical, clinical, and behavioral sciences and evaluate the
dental cognitive skills of international candidates seeking to earn admission
into advanced standing programs in the US dental schools. The INBDE became
effective on August 1, 2020. Itâ€™s the same test that international dentists gave
earlier in 2 parts: the NBDE 1 and the NBDE 2. Now they are taken collectively
and are called the INBDE instead.
