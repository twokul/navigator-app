## Overview

To understand the process for foreign-trained dentists, it helps to first look at
how becoming a dentist normally works in the U.S.

Students graduate from high school and then complete a **4-year undergraduate
degree** with pre-dental courses (biology, chemistry, physics, etc.). Next, they
take the **[Dental Admission Test](official.dat)**, administered by the American Dental
Association (ADA). The DAT has 280 questions covering natural sciences, reading
comprehension, and quantitative reasoning.

Admission to dental school is competitive and based on **DAT scores, GPA,
interviews, and letters of recommendation**. Most dental schools last **4 years**
(a few offer 3-year programs). The first 2 years focus on pre-clinical studies,
while the last 2 years are dedicated to clinical training. Graduates earn either
a **DDS (Doctor of Dental Surgery)** or a **DMD (Doctor of Dental Medicine)**.
Both degrees are equivalent.

## Training & Specialization

Unlike some countries, the U.S. does **not require a one-year clinical
internship** after dental school. Graduates can immediately apply for state
licensure.

Those seeking extra training may enter programs like **GPR (General Practice
Residency)** or **AEGD (Advanced Education in General Dentistry)**. Dentists can
also pursue one of 11 recognized specialties accredited by CODA and the ADA:

- **Dental Anesthesiology**
- **Dental Public Health**
- **Endodontics**
- **Oral and Maxillofacial Pathology**
- **Oral and Maxillofacial Radiology**
- **Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery**
- **Oral Medicine**
- **Orofacial Pain**
- **Orthodontics and Dentofacial Orthopedics**
- **Pediatric Dentistry**
- **Periodontics**
- **Prosthodontics**

More information about advanced education programs can be found
[here](official.coda).

<Aside>
  Note: General dentists can legally perform any dental procedure, even those typically done by
  specialists. However, insurance companies reimburse general dentists at lower rates for those
  procedures.

## Exams

During dental school, students must pass both **theoretical and practical
exams**.

- The most important theoretical test is the **[INBDE (Integrated National Board
  Dental Examination)](official.inbde)**.
- For clinical licensure, students take a **regional practical exam**. There are
  5 main versions:
  1. **CRDTS** – Central Regional Dental Testing Service
  2. **CITA** – Council of Interstate Testing Agencies
  3. **CDCA** – Commission on Dental Competency Assessments (formerly NERB)
  4. **SRTA** – Southern Regional Testing Agency
  5. **WREB** – Western Regional Examining Board

Each exam is accepted in different states. The **CDCA** exam is the most widely
recognized. Alongside exams, students must also complete clinical requirements
(e.g., fillings, crowns, root canals).

With a **DDS/DMD degree**, a passed **INBDE**, and a **regional board exam**
(often CDCA), graduates can obtain an initial dental license in most U.S. states.

## U.S. Pathway vs. Foreign-Trained Pathway

Here’s a quick comparison to see where international dentists fit into the U.S. system:

| **Step**        | **U.S.-Trained Dentist**       | **Foreign-Trained Dentist**                                                             |
| --------------- | ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| High School     | Graduate from U.S. high school | Graduate from home-country high school                                                  |
| Undergraduate   | 4-year pre-dental degree       | Dental degree from non-CODA school                                                      |
| Admission Test  | DAT (Dental Admission Test)    | Often not required if applying to Advanced Standing Programs                            |
| Dental School   | 4 years (DMD/DDS)              | Must complete a 2–3 year **Advanced Standing Program** at a U.S. CODA-accredited school |
| Licensing Exams | INBDE + Regional Board Exam    | Same exams required (INBDE + regional board)                                            |
| Internship      | Optional GPR/AEGD              | Optional GPR/AEGD after Advanced Standing                                               |
| Specialization  | 11 recognized specialties      | Same options available after Advanced Standing                                          |

Now let’s look at the process for international (foreign-trained) dentists.
