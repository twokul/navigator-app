title: How to Prepare
---

## Strengthen Clinical Skills

- Practice tooth preparations on a typodont using handpieces and burs similar to
  those used in U.S. dental schools.
- Work on margin accuracy, taper, and depth to meet U.S. dental standards
  according to the guidelines. I will also include preparation resources and
  videos that outline specific criteria for school bench exams.
- Focus on quality and consistency and try to stay within timeframe as the time
  is limited.

<Aside>
  I did not order any school specific materials, I practiced on the ones I could easily buy from
  Ebay or Amazon, because I was confident in my hand skills and I only needed to learn and practice
  school specific preparation criteria. But If you are not confident in your hand skills you can buy
  school specific materials, such as typodont or teeth or wax material for carving the schools are
  using on their bench exams etc. Here you should ask yourself how confident you feel and decide
  whether to buy them or practice on basic materials.

## Familiarize Yourself with U.S. Dental Standards

- Study guidelines from the **ADA, prosthodontic protocols, and restorative
  dentistry manuals that are standart** in U.S. dental schools.
- Learn the proper **notation for documentation** and how to write structured
  **clinical notes**.

## Improve Theoretical Knowledge

- Review **radiographic interpretation, diagnosis, and treatment planning**.
- Understand **biomaterials, restorative techniques, and prosthodontic
  concepts**.

## Take Bench Test Prep Courses

Many candidates attend **bench test preparation courses** offered by dental
academies or private instructors. These courses provide:

- Hands-on training in **tooth preparations and restorations**
- Mock exams simulating actual test conditions
- Feedback from instructors experienced in U.S. dental standards

## Develop Time Management Strategies

The bench test not only evaluates clinical skills but also tests adaptability to
American dental standards and protocols. By practicing consistently, managing
time effectively, and staying calm under pressure, you can increase your chances
of performing well and securing a spot in your desired program.

## Bench Test Tips

Each dental school has different **bench test requirements**, so you'll need to
check individually. Some schools provide detailed instructions and grading
criteria, while others only list what you can bring. The test may take place
**on the same day as your interview or on a separate day**.

Bench tests are **not free**, with costs ranging from **hundreds to thousands of
dollars**.

## Practical Tips for the Bench Test

- **Check Equipment Requirements:** Some schools provide burs or handpieces,
  while others expect you to bring your own. Always confirm with the school, but
  **bring the tools youâ€™re comfortable with** to avoid unnecessary stress.
- **Focus on Quality Practice:** Consistent, structured practice is key. Instead
  of mindless repetition, focus on the **grading criteria** used by each school if
  provided or licensure exams.
- **Consider a Prep Course:** Some institutions and private tutors in the U.S.
  offer **bench test preparation courses** for internationally trained dentists.
  - **Read Reviews Before Enrolling:** If you're considering a prep course,
    check reviews and feedback from others who have taken it. **YouTube is a
    great place to find firsthand experiences.**
