The next step toward earning your DDS degree is taking the **Test of English as
a Foreign Language (TOEFL)**. This standardized test measures the English
proficiency of non-native speakers who wish to enroll in universities in the
U.S. and more than 150 other countries.

<Aside>
  The TOEFL exam is identical whether taken inside or outside the U.S. Your responses are evaluated
  online, meaning your examiner could be located anywhereâ€”for example, you might take the test in
  the U.K. while your evaluator is in Singapore.
</Aside>

The TOEFL is competitive, and scores range from **0 to 120**. Most U.S. dental
schools view **100 or above** as a strong score, but each university has its own
minimum requirements. Be sure to check the specific TOEFL score criteria for
each school on their official websites.
