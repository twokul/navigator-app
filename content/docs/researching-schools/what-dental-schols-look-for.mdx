title: What Do Dental Schools Look For?
---

Many applicants believe that dental schools are looking for candidates who excel
in every possible area (well-rounded applicant). While this is important, in
reality, admissions committees focus on **building a diverse class**, not just
selecting the most well-rounded individuals. They aim to bring together students
with different strengths and experiences—those passionate about **clinical
excellence, research, public health, innovation, or leadership.** Instead of
choosing applicants with identical qualifications, schools look for candidates
who complement one another and align with their overall mission.

Consider it like assembling an orchestra. A successful symphony isn’t composed
solely of violinists; it requires **percussionists, brass players, woodwinds,
and a conductor** to create a harmonious performance. Similarly, a dental school
seeks a balanced mix of students who each contribute in their own way. Some will
bring expertise in patient care, others will advance dental technology, and some
will focus on community outreach. Your goal isn’t to be perfect in every aspect
but to highlight **what makes you a valuable addition to the ensemble.**

Being a well-rounded applicant increases your adaptability, but what truly makes
you stand out is how your **individual strengths contribute to the bigger
picture.** Your goal is to **showcase how your strengths, experience, and
aspirations contribute to the school's mission** and make you a valuable
addition to their class.

## Key Factors to Consider When Choosing Dental Schools

  specialization or academia.

Example:

- **San Francisco (UCSF) & New York (NYU, Columbia)** → High tuition + high cost
  of living.

  cost of living, more affordable education.

  services**?

Example:

- **UCLA & Harvard** → Higher specialization rates.
- **Boston University & Colorado** → More graduates go directly into **private
  practice**.
