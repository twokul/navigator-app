title: Become a Dental Hygienist as a Foreign-Trained Dentist
description: Step-by-step guide on how internationally trained dentists can become licensed dental hygienists in the U.S.
---

For internationally trained dentists, the U.S. licensure path can be **long,
costly, and uncertain**. While most pursue **DDS or DMD degrees** through
Advanced Standing Programs (ASPs), a growing number of dentists are choosing an
alternative route — becoming a **licensed dental hygienist**.

This option offers a **shorter, more affordable, and practical path** to
clinical work in the U.S. It provides **legal income**, **hands-on experience**,
and helps strengthen your profile if you plan to apply to dental school later.

With workforce shortages and new legislative changes, several states now make it
possible for foreign-trained dentists to become hygienists **without completing
a U.S.-based hygiene program**. This guide outlines the key requirements, state
pathways, and strategies to help you succeed.

## General Requirements

Traditionally, to become a dental hygienist in the U.S., you must:

- **Graduate from an Accredited U.S. Dental Hygiene Program** – CODA-accredited
  programs are listed [here](https://coda.ada.org/find-a-program/search-dental-programs#sort=%40codastatecitysort%20ascending).
- **Pass the National Board Dental Hygiene Examination (NBDHE)** – A written
  exam assessing theoretical and applied knowledge.

- **Complete a Clinical Board Examination** – Usually a regional or state exam.

## Why This Path Makes Sense

Becoming a hygienist is not a “step down” — it’s a **strategic bridge** into the
U.S. dental field.

- ✅ Gain **legal, hands-on clinical experience**
- ✅ Strengthen your **CV and dental school application**
- ✅ Earn **income while waiting for exams or interviews**
- ✅ Build your **network and U.S. clinical familiarity**
- ✅ Use it as a **launchpad** for other state licenses
- ✅ Choose a **flexible, lower-debt career** if you prefer not to pursue DDS

Many foreign-trained dentists use this route to **demonstrate commitment** to
U.S. dentistry while earning and learning simultaneously.
