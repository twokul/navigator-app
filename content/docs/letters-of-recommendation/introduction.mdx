description: How to strategically use multiple letters of recommendation (LORs) for dental school applications
---

In the United States, the **culture, work ethic, and academic environment** are
vastly different from what we may be used to in our home countries. If we want
to **succeed**, we need to think and act with the same level of professionalism,
clarity, and strategic mindset that Americans do. This means understanding the
**expectations** of the system and adapting to them. A strong **letter of
recommendation** is not just a formality—it’s a powerful tool that can
significantly impact our chances of admission. In the U.S., admissions
committees expect LORs to be **specific, structured, and filled with concrete
examples**, not just general praise. To compete with top applicants, we must
ensure our LORs reflect the qualities and achievements that truly set us apart.

Unlike in many other countries, where LORs may hold less weight or follow a more
standardized format, U.S. admissions committees place significant emphasis on
personal insights provided by recommenders. A great LOR can give **context** to
an applicant’s achievements, offer **examples** of their skills, and demonstrate
how they will contribute to the academic and social environment of the
institution. Understanding what makes a **strong and compelling LOR** is
essential—it’s not just about glowing praise, but about crafting a letter that
speaks directly to the applicant’s **unique strengths** and **fit for the
program**, helping them stand out in a pool of applicants.
