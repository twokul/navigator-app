Even after receiving your **acceptance letter**, there’s still important
paperwork ahead. This stage includes applying for your **student visa**,
arranging **student loans**, and preparing for **relocation**.

## Student Visa

Visit your country’s **U.S. embassy website** (or the embassy where you’ll have your interview) to review student visa requirements. While these may vary by country, the following steps and tips are common:

1. **Receive your Form I-20:** Once your school issues your Certificate of
   Eligibility (Form I-20) for Nonimmigrant (F-1) Student Status, you can schedule
   your visa appointment. → [Official Student Visa
   Information](official.studentVisaInformation)

2. **Pay the SEVIS Fee:** Before your interview, pay your Student and Exchange
   Visitor Information System (SEVIS) fee to U.S. Homeland Security. Bring the
   receipt to your interview.

3. **Prepare for the Interview:** Be ready to explain:
   - **Why you chose to study in the U.S.**
   - **Why you selected this specific school** (show familiarity with its program and advantages).
   - **How you will fund your education** — this is often the most important part. You must prove you have sufficient funds to cover all expenses.
     - If sponsored, your sponsor should provide a signed **letter of sponsorship** with their bank balance and the amount they will contribute.
   - **Your post-graduation plans** — answer honestly and clearly.

## Loans and Financial Planning

If you need financial assistance, **private loans** are available but usually require a **co-signer** who is a U.S. citizen or permanent resident.  
If you are a **green card holder or U.S. citizen**, you can apply for **federal loans and financial aid**.

You may **not enter the U.S. earlier than 30 days** before your program’s official start date.
