title: New Jersey Dental Licensure, Step-by-Step Application Guide
description: A clear walkthrough of the dental licensure application process in New Jersey — from submitting your form to receiving your two-year license
---

Let's take a look at how the dental **licensure application process** works
using **New Jersey** as an example.

Applying for a license is the **final step** in a long journey that includes
completing your education, graduating from a CODA-accredited program (or an
equivalent), and passing the required exams. I’ll start from the end — the
actual licensing stage — so you can see what the destination looks like before
we break down the earlier steps in detail.

Each U.S. state has its own set of requirements, but the **overall structure is
very similar**. The main variations are usually in the **details**, such as
which clinical exams are accepted or what documentation is required.

Below is a screenshot from the official New Jersey Board of Dentistry website
showing the application requirements:

### Step-by-Step Process (New Jersey Example)

1. **Complete the Application Form**  
   Fill out the [Application for a Dental License](states.newJersey.dentistLicensure) and mail it with a **$125 check** to the board.

2. **Submit Required Documents**  
   This is typically the **most detailed and time-consuming** part of the process. I’ll discuss these document requirements in depth in the next section.

3. **Receive Fingerprinting Instructions**  
   Once your initial application is received, you’ll be sent instructions on how to complete your fingerprinting.

4. **Complete Fingerprinting & Background Check**  
   Schedule your appointment and complete fingerprinting. Your fingerprints are sent to the **FBI** and the **State Board** for a criminal background check.

5. **Pass the State Orientation Exam**  
   This exam covers New Jersey’s dental laws and professional conduct standards — including **license renewal**, **continuing education (CE)**, and **advertising regulations**.  
   → [NJ Code of Conduct](states.newJersey.codeOfConduct)

6. **Submit Additional Documents (If Requested)**  
   The board may contact you directly if any information or documents are missing.

7. **Receive Payment Form & Finalize License**  
   Once approved, the board will send a payment form for your **two-year dental license**. After payment, your license becomes active and must be renewed every two years.
