Minnesota is the only state that offers a dental license to qualified dentists
from non-accredited dental schools without requiring additional training in the
US. In 2008, the Minnesota Board of Dentistry established criteria allowing
these dentists to apply for a license in the state. Applicants must still pass
exams such as the INBDE and TOEFL, as these scores are part of the application
process (click [the

details).

The Board's Credentials Committee reviews applications every six weeks on a
first-come, first-served basis. They might call for an interview and request
patient records at their office in Minnesota. If the Committee finds the
applicant's education equivalent to a US dental graduate, the applicant can then
take the Minnesota bench exam and a Board-approved clinical licensing exam.
Dentists licensed in this way receive a limited general dental license and must
work under the supervision of a licensed dentist in Minnesota for three years,
who may restrict the types of services they perform. After these three years,
they can qualify for an unrestricted general dental license in Minnesota. For
