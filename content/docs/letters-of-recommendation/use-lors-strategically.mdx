Having multiple **letters of recommendation (LORs)** is an advantage only if each
one adds a **distinct perspective**. Aim for a well-rounded picture of your
abilities, experiences, and character. Avoid repetition—if all letters say the
same thing, they lose impact.

## Show Diverse Perspectives

Each recommender should highlight a **different facet** of your profile. A strong
set typically includes:

### U.S. Dentist (Shadowing or Work Experience)

- **Focus on:** Clinical experience, professionalism, patient interaction, work ethic in a dental setting.
- **Why it matters:** Demonstrates familiarity with the **U.S. healthcare system** and your ability to function well in it.

### Science Professor

- **Focus on:** Academic strength, critical thinking, mastery of complex material, problem-solving.
- **Why it matters:** Shows the **intellectual readiness** to handle a rigorous dental curriculum.

### Employer or Supervisor (Healthcare or Volunteer Work Preferred)

- **Focus on:** Work ethic, leadership, teamwork, communication, patient-centered care, dedication to service.
- **Why it matters:** Highlights **interpersonal skills, responsibility, and commitment to patient care.**

### Mentor/Supervisor from Extracurriculars or Leadership Roles

- **Focus on:** Leadership, initiative, community involvement, passion for dentistry, ability to inspire and organize others.
- **Why it matters:** Signals potential to **lead within the profession** and give back to the community.

## Avoid Redundancy—Make Letters Complementary

Each letter should emphasize **different strengths**. If two letters repeat the
same adjectives, they add little value.

### Weak (Redundant) Set

- Two dentists describing similar shadowing experiences
- Two science professors repeating the same academic traits
- General praise with no specific stories or outcomes

### Strong (Complementary) Set

- **Dentist:** “Anna showed meticulous attention to detail in clinic, communicated effectively with patients, and adapted quickly to a fast-paced environment.”
- **Professor:** “Anna ranked among the top students in anatomy, demonstrating advanced critical thinking and the ability to apply complex concepts in lab.”
- **Supervisor:** “Anna led our outreach events, organized volunteers, and built trust with the community through clear, empathetic communication.”

> Letters should fit comfortably on **one page** (roughly **500–700 words**).  
> Too short can feel perfunctory; too long risks losing the reader’s attention.

## If You Don’t Have a U.S. Recommender

If you lack a **U.S.-based** recommender, prioritize those who can strongly
attest to your **professionalism and skill**—but make it a goal to gain U.S.
experience, which **significantly improves** your chances.

For non-U.S. recommenders:

- Ask them to **introduce their credentials** (e.g., Head of Department, Research Lead).
- Briefly note **achievements or reputation** that establish authority.

To build a U.S. reference:

- Seek short-term **volunteering**, **remote roles**, or **shadowing** opportunities.
- **Network** with faculty, alumni, or local practitioners at target programs.

U.S. dental schools place substantial weight on **credible recommendations**—
especially from individuals connected to their institutions. A strong internal
endorsement can meaningfully influence outcomes. If your recommender has prior
ties to the school (e.g., alumnus), it’s worth **mentioning that connection** in
the letter.
