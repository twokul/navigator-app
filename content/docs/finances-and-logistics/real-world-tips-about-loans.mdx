title: Real World Tips About Loans
description: What You Might Not Find on a School Website
---

If you're actively looking for student loans (and maybe panicking a little),
here's a helpful breakdown based on real conversations with current students who
have already gone through the process. These insights go beyond the basics and
cover the practical things you should expect when dealing with loans as a dental
student.

## Which Lenders to Consider?

While many banks offer student loans, students often recommend:

- **Sallie Mae** – widely known, but may lean toward higher interest rates
  (especially for housing).
- **SoFi**, **Earnest**, and **Prodigy Finance** – more student-loan focused,
  often with better education-specific rates.
- **Discover** – was a popular option in the past but is currently closed to new
  applicants for student loans.

<Aside>
  Pro Tip: Always apply to multiple banks — some will offer rate matching, which gives you the power
  to negotiate better terms.

## Loan Structure: What to Expect

- **Loans are issued per academic year**, not for the full program upfront.
- You'll need to **renew your loan annually**, which requires updated
  documentation and approval.
- Schools typically have a **maximum allowed loan per quarter/year**, which
  includes both tuition and estimated personal expenses.

Example cap (based on one school's policy):

- ~$27K–$28K for tuition
- ~$5K for personal/living expenses
- **Total cap: ~$33K per quarter**

If you need more than the cap, contact your school's financial aid officers —
they can explain exception processes.

## Interest Rates: Fixed vs. Variable

- Most students currently secure **interest rates around 5%**, though they vary.
- **Fixed rates** offer predictability — safer if you don't want surprises.
- **Variable rates** start lower (as low as 2%) but can increase significantly
  over time (up to 12–16% for some lenders without co-signers).

<Aside>Many students opt for fixed rates for peace of mind.</Aside>

## Repayment Options During School

You can usually choose between:

1. **Interest-only payments while studying** – Some banks offer a small discount
   (e.g., 0.25%) if you pay the interest while in school.
2. **Full deferment** – No payments until after graduation, but interest
   accrues.

After graduation, most banks offer a **6–12 month grace period** before full
repayments kick in.

## What Monthly Payments Look Like

Repayment is gradual and scales up:

- Early in the program: ~$100–$150/month
- Final year or post-grad: Up to **$600–$700/month**, depending on your loan
  size and interest

The good news? With smart budgeting and consistent income, some students have
paid off their loans **within 2–3 years after graduation**.

## Loans With vs. Without a Co-Signer

### With a Co-Signer:

- Can significantly **lower your interest rate**
- The co-signer's **credit score matters a lot**
- Some banks **don’t accept co-signers on H-1B visas** — check eligibility
  carefully

### Without a Co-Signer:

- **Options are limited**, but possible
- Lenders like **Prodigy Finance** and **MPower** are more likely to approve
- Expect **higher interest rates** (up to 12–16%)

<Aside>
  You can apply to different banks with different co-signers and request different amounts.

## Timing & Planning Tips

- **Loan approvals take time** — schools may need up to **160 days** to finalize
  your loan paperwork.
- **Don't apply for loans too early** — approvals can expire within 30–60 days.
- Start prepping your documents in advance, but finalize your application
  **closer to your visa process or tuition deadline.**

## After Graduation — The OPT Year

Most dental grads (especially international ones) use the **OPT period (12
months)** to:

- Start working
- Begin repaying loans
- Secure sponsorship for work visas (if needed)

Students say **finding sponsors during OPT isn't usually difficult**, but it's
still something to plan for early.

## Summary: If You're Navigating Loans Right Now

- Compare **at least 3 lenders**
- Decide whether you want **fixed or variable rates**
- Prepare to **renew your loan each academic year**
- Know your school's **loan limits and timeline**
- Don't panic — with a plan, you can manage or even pay off your loan faster than expected
