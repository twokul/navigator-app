Financing a U.S. education as an international student can seem daunting, but scholarships, assistantships, and institutional aid can make it achievable — if you know where to look and how to apply.

---

### University Scholarships & Financial Aid

Some U.S. universities offer meaningful support to international students:

- If your ASP program is at a **private university** (like USC, NYU, or BU), you **may qualify for merit-based or departmental scholarships**, even as an international student.
- **Need-based aid** is less common for ASP students but can be available if you’re classified as a degree-seeking student.

When researching, look for these terms on school websites:

- “Scholarships for international students”
- “Need-based aid”
- “Merit scholarships”

### Assistantships for Graduate Students

Graduate assistantships can offset tuition or living expenses through work at the university:

1. **Teaching Assistantships (TAs)** – Assist with courses, grading, or labs.
2. **Research Assistantships (RAs)** – Contribute to faculty research projects.
3. **Administrative Assistantships** – Work in departments like admissions or student affairs.

> _Assistantships are rare in ASP programs due to clinical commitments but may be available through public health or research departments, especially if you’re doing a dual degree or elective research. Contact your department for details._

### Limitations for ASP Students

- **Federal Aid (FAFSA)** – Only for U.S. citizens and permanent residents.
- **State Aid** – Often limited to residents, but check for exceptions.
- **Military/Service Scholarships** – Require U.S. citizenship or permanent residency (e.g., HPSP, HSCP).

### Types of Scholarships You Can Apply For

- **Need-Based Scholarships** – Based on financial circumstances.
- **Merit-Based Scholarships** – Reward academic or extracurricular excellence.
- **Athletic Scholarships** – For undergraduate athletes (not applicable to ASP students).
- **Country-Specific or Minority Scholarships** – For students from certain regions or backgrounds.
- **Privately Funded Scholarships** – Offered by donors or organizations for developing countries or specific fields.
- **Partial Scholarships** – One-time or renewable awards ($1,000–$5,000).
- **Government or International Organization Scholarships** – From entities like Fulbright or the World Bank.

### How to Search for University Scholarships

Visit each university’s financial aid page and check:

**Common Keywords to Look For:**

- “Financial Aid”
- “Need-based scholarships”
- “Merit-based scholarships”
- “Scholarships for international students”
- “Admissions & Aid”
- “Tuition Assistance”

### External & Country-Based Scholarships

#### Country-Based Scholarships

Search for funding specifically for students from your home country by using keywords like _“scholarships for students from [your country]”_.

#### Government-Funded Scholarships

Check both U.S. and home-country government programs for international study sponsorships.

#### Privately Funded Scholarships

Many non-profit or minority organizations support students from developing countries or underrepresented backgrounds.

#### International Organization Scholarships

Major institutions (UN, OAS, World Bank) offer scholarships — often highly competitive and limited to graduate-level students.

#### Partial Scholarships

These smaller awards ($1,000–$5,000) can help cover specific costs and are often awarded through competitions.

> _Start searching at least 8–9 months before your academic year begins._

### Student Loans for International Students

International students can apply for **private loans**, though most require a **U.S. co-signer** responsible for repayment if you default.
