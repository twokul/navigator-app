Researching dental schools as a foreign-trained dentist is the foundation of
your U.S. dental journey. This step helps you understand your options,
eligibility, and the key differences between programs before you apply.

## How to Research Dental Schools

Start by identifying schools accredited by the **Commission on Dental
Accreditation (CODA)**. Compare different programs using the table below and
explore both centralized and independent application options.

You can search for programs here: [Program Finder (ADEA
CAAPID)](official.caapidProgramFinder) or use our [Schools
Database](/c/researching-schools/schools-database).

<Aside>
  Some schools are **not listed** in the Program Finder because they do not participate in the
  centralized application service. You can find a complete list of accredited schools on the
  American Dental Association (ADA) website: [Current list of all accredited dental
  schools.](official.adea.dentalSchools)
</Aside>

Researching dental schools as an international dentist who wants to pursue a
career in the U.S. involves several steps. Here's a guide on how to properly
conduct this research, the criteria to consider, the questions to ask, and some
materials to make your research easier.

This spreadsheet will help you stay organized and make an informed decision. Keep in mind that **advanced standing programs are highly competitive**, and understanding each program’s requirements will increase your chances of success.

Use these research templates to structure your findings:
