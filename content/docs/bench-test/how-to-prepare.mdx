title: How to Prepare for the Bench Test
description: Practical tips and preparation strategies to strengthen your clinical, theoretical, and time-management skills for the U.S. dental school bench test.
---

## Strengthen Clinical Skills

- Practice tooth preparations on a typodont using handpieces and burs similar to
  those used in U.S. dental schools.
- Focus on **margin accuracy, taper, and depth** according to U.S. dental
  standards. Preparation resources and videos outlining school-specific criteria
  will be included.
- Prioritize **quality, precision, and consistency**, and train yourself to work
  within time limits.

<Aside>
  I personally did not order school-specific materials — I practiced using typodonts and burs I
  found on eBay and Amazon because I was confident in my hand skills and only needed to adapt to
  school-specific preparation criteria. If you’re less confident, consider buying the same
  typodonts, teeth, or wax materials used by your target schools. Ask yourself how confident you
  feel, then decide whether to invest in specialized materials or stick to standard ones.

## Familiarize Yourself with U.S. Dental Standards

- Review **ADA guidelines**, **prosthodontic protocols**, and **restorative
  dentistry manuals** commonly used in U.S. dental schools.
- Learn proper **documentation formats** and how to write structured
  **clinical notes**.

## Improve Theoretical Knowledge

- Strengthen your understanding of **radiographic interpretation, diagnosis, and
  treatment planning**.
- Review **biomaterials, restorative techniques, and prosthodontic concepts** to
  ensure a well-rounded knowledge base.

## Take Bench Test Preparation Courses

Many applicants attend **bench test prep courses** offered by dental academies
or private instructors. These typically include:

- Hands-on training in **tooth preparations and restorations**
- **Mock exams** simulating real test conditions
- Personalized **feedback** from instructors experienced with U.S. dental standards

## Develop Time Management Strategies

The bench test evaluates not only technical ability but also your adaptability
to U.S. clinical protocols. Practice under timed conditions, stay calm, and
maintain focus to perform your best.

## Bench Test Overview

Each dental school has unique **bench test requirements**. Some provide detailed
instructions and grading rubrics, while others only list allowed instruments.
Tests may occur **on the same day as your interview or separately**, and fees
range from **hundreds to thousands of dollars**.

## Practical Tips

- **Confirm Equipment Requirements:** Some schools provide instruments, while
  others expect you to bring your own. Always verify details, but use tools
  you’re most comfortable with.
- **Practice with Purpose:** Focus your practice on the **evaluation criteria**
  each school uses (if available).
- **Consider a Reputable Prep Course:** Many private tutors and academies in the
  U.S. offer bench test training.
  - **Check Reviews Before Enrolling:** Look for firsthand feedback on forums or
    YouTube before committing.
