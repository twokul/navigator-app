description: Step-by-step overview of the core requirements for obtaining a U.S. dental license
---

To practice as a dentist in the United States, you must obtain a license. Each
of the 50 states has its own dental board — the governing body that regulates
dentistry and issues licenses. To find a state board, simply search for
"[state abbreviation] dental board" and you’ll be directed to their official
website, which outlines application procedures and requirements.

At the national level, the [American Dental Association
(ADA)](professional.ada.main) serves as the leading professional organization. It
provides extensive resources on licensure, exams, and professional standards.

While specific requirements vary by state, every candidate must complete three
core steps:

1. **Educational Requirements**
   You must graduate from a dental school accredited by the Commission on Dental
   Accreditation (CODA). If your degree is from a non-CODA school, you may pursue
   an advanced standing or international dental program in the U.S. (covered in
   more detail later in this guide).

   <Aside>
     A CODA-accredited program is one that meets the standards of the [Commission on Dental
     Accreditation (CODA)](official.coda). Accreditation is granted only after a rigorous review
     process.

2. **Written Exam**
   All licensure candidates must pass the **Integrated National Board Dental
   Examination (INBDE)**. This exam, launched in 2020, replaced the NBDE Part I
   and II and reflects modern dental education and clinical practice.

3. **Clinical Exam**
   Clinical examination requirements differ by state. Most states rely on regional
   testing agencies, which means timing and eligibility rules vary. You can review
   the specific exam requirements and find contact information for each dental
   board via the [ADA Licensure Map](professional.ada.dentalLicensureMap).
