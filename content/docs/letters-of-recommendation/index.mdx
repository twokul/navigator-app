title: The Power of a Strong Letter of Recommendation
description: How to strategically craft and use LORs to stand out in U.S. dental school applications
---

In the United States, the **academic, professional, and cultural environment**
operates with a different level of structure and expectation than in many other
countries. To **succeed**, international applicants must align with these
standards—demonstrating professionalism, clarity, and strategic thinking
throughout the application process. One of the most influential yet often
misunderstood components is the **Letter of Recommendation (LOR)**.

In U.S. admissions, a strong LOR is far more than a formality—it’s a **powerful
endorsement** that can meaningfully strengthen your application. Admissions
committees expect letters that are **specific, evidence-based, and
personalized**, not vague or generic. The best LORs highlight **concrete
examples** of your skills, work ethic, and potential, offering a deeper insight
into who you are as a future student and professional.

Unlike in many other countries, where recommendation letters may follow a
formulaic template or hold less influence, U.S. dental schools place
**considerable weight** on the personal perspective of your recommenders. A
compelling LOR provides **context** for your achievements, shows how you’ve
applied your knowledge in real settings, and demonstrates your **fit for the
program**. Understanding how to guide your recommenders in writing impactful,
detailed, and sincere letters is key to making your application stand out among
top-tier candidates.
