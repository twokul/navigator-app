title: Step 8. Invitation to Interview
---

After submitting your **CAAPID and supplemental applications**, the next crucial
step is **waiting for an interview invitation**. Some applicants receive
**multiple interview invitations**, while others may not receive any. This
largely depends on various factors, including:

- **Your overall application strength** (GPA, INBDE, and TOEFL scores)
- **Clinical and work experience** (U.S. and international)
- **Extracurricular activities and achievements**
- **Quality of personal statement and letters of recommendation**

Since the selection process is competitive, it's essential to **stay proactive**
while waiting.

## What to Do While Waiting for an Interview

#### Improve Your Communication and Presentation Skills

Schools assess your ability to communicate effectively, so work on your
**fluency, clarity, and confidence** in English.

#### Continue Strengthening Your Profile

You can **add new experiences and achievements** to your CAAPID application even
after submission. Schools get notified when you upload additional documents,
which can **boost your profile** and increase your chances of selection. I
highly recommend to update the schools on your new experiences and reiterate
your interest in the interview if you did not hear from them by January.

- **Example:** I submitted my CAAPID application in **mid-March** but kept
  enhancing my profile. When I obtained my **Registered Dental Assistant (RDA)
  license** and was **invited to speak at a U.S. conference**, I uploaded these
  achievements to CAAPID. This helped draw more attention to my application and
  demonstrated my dedication to professional growth.

#### Prepare for Bench Tests If Required

Some schools require a **bench test**, which is a **practical skill assessment**
of your clinical abilities. Make sure to review common exercises such as crown
preparations, cavity restorations, and wax-ups.

#### Understand the Different Interview Formats

Dental schools use different types of interviews, and preparation is key:

- **Traditional One-on-One (1:1) Interviews** – A standard interview with
  faculty members.
- **Multiple Mini Interviews (MMI)** – A series of short, timed scenarios
  assessing your communication, ethics, and decision-making skills.
- **Problem-Based Learning (PBL) Interviews** – Group discussions where
  candidates analyze and solve a **clinical case scenario** together.
- **Panel Interviews** – A formal interview with multiple faculty members asking
  questions.

#### Stay Confident and Positive

Confidence plays a crucial role in **how you present yourself** during the
interview. Even if you don't receive an invitation right away, **stay optimistic**
and continue working on your professional development.

## Final Tip

Use the waiting period wisely to **refine your skills, gain new experiences, and
prepare for different interview formats**. Every small improvement in your
profile can increase your chances of securing an interview and, ultimately,
**getting accepted into your desired program**!

Interviews at most schools are divided into two parts: [personal
interview](/c/personal-interview/introduction) and [bench
examination](/c/bench-test/introduction).
