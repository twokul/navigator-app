## Pros & Cons of Bench Test Prep Courses

### Pros (Why You Should Take One)

- **Structured Training:** You learn exactly **what and how to practice**,
  instead of guessing.
- **Realistic Mock Exams:** Simulating the real test **reduces stress and
  improves time management**.
- **Personalized Feedback:** Instructors **point out mistakes** and help refine
  your techniques.
- **Networking Opportunity:** You meet other international dentists who are
  preparing for the same exams.
- **Saves Time:** Instead of months of trial and error, a structured course
  **speeds up the learning process**.

### Cons (Why You Might Skip It)

- **Expensive:** Costs can be high, especially for multi-day courses.
- **Time Commitment:** Some courses require **taking time off work or travel**.
- **Not Always Necessary:** If you’re already confident in your hand skills, you
  might not need it.
- **Variable Quality:** Some courses **lack proper guidance**, so **research
  reviews before enrolling**.

## Should You Take a Bench Test Prep Course?

Consider taking a course if:

- You are not confident in your hand skills, need **hands-on guidance** to
  improve them.
- You struggle with **specific preparations** like PFM, zirconia crowns, or
  class II restorations.
- You learn better in a **structured, in-person environment** with instructor
  feedback.
- You want a **mock exam experience** before the real test.

You might skip it if:

- You have **strong clinical skills** and can **self-practice effectively**.
- You already **have access to U.S.-trained mentors** for feedback.
- You **can’t afford it** and prefer to practice using **YouTube tutorials and
  self-study**.

I preferred self-study for my bench test preparation because I already had prior
experience and was confident in my hand skills. My main focus was brushing up on
school-specific requirements, memorizing the exact measurements for each prep,
and ensuring I followed the guidelines precisely. Dr. Stevenson's videos were
more than enough for the hand skill exercises, and I used other resources for
wax carving practice. You can find the links further in the guide.

Ultimately, choosing between self-study and working with a tutor depends on how
well you know yourself. I've always been someone who learns best independently—I
can manage my time effectively and absorb information as long as I have the
right study materials. If you’re the same way, self-study might be a great
option. But if you learn better with guidance, a tutor could be the right
choice. Go with what works best for you!
