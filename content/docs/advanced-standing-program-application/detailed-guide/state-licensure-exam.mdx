After you finish your DDS/ DMD from the advanced standing program, several
options are open such as working as an associate dentist in the self-practice,
being a practice owner in the U.S., working as faculty in a reputed dental
school, etc.

Candidates have to take the licensure exam in the U.S. before starting
practising here. The criteria for the licensure exam are specific to specific
states. These can be obtained according to the state the candidate wishes to
move to.
