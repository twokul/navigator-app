## U.S. Experience Matters — Even a Little Goes a Long Way

For international dentists, **any dental-related experience in the U.S.** is extremely valuable—regardless of whether you are a new graduate or an experienced professional in your home country.

Having U.S. exposure demonstrates adaptability, interest in the local healthcare system, and a proactive mindset. It can truly set your application apart.

## Practical Ways to Gain U.S. Dental Experience

### Clinical & Academic Involvement

- **Shadow U.S.-licensed dentists** in private practices or dental schools.
- **Volunteer** at dental clinics, community clinics or healthcare centers.
- **Dental assisting** (in-office training or certified roles).
- **Dental Hygienist** (possible in Florida with passed INBDE). Learn more [here.](/c/related-paths-and-resources/become-dental-hygienist-as-asp-applicant)
- **Observer programs** at dental schools or hospitals.
- **Master’s programs** in public health or healthcare management (with dental focus).

### Related Experiences That Also Add Value

- **Dental Startups:** Join early-stage startups in the dental tech or health space. Roles in operations, content, research, education, marketing, or user experience—all give you U.S. exposure and demonstrate versatility.
- **Dental Technician Work:** If you have access to a lab or technician training, this can showcase **hand skills** and attention to detail—qualities highly regarded in dentistry.
- **Volunteer in Community Clinics:** Especially in underserved areas or clinics affiliated with dental schools.

<Aside>
  If you're already in the U.S. for the INBDE exam, try extending your stay to gain clinical
  exposure by shadowing or volunteering at a nearby clinic or dental school.

## Strategic Tips for Building Your Profile

### Volunteer Where You Want to Study

If you have a specific school in mind, **try volunteering or shadowing there.** If you don’t know anyone, reach out to **current students** on Instagram, LinkedIn, or student forums and politely ask for guidance or introductions.

<Aside>
  Networking can change everything. Connections often lead to otherwise hidden opportunities.
</Aside>

### How Much Volunteer Experience Is Enough?

While there's no official minimum, many successful applicants report logging **at least 100 hours** of **consistent volunteer work in one place** (e.g., 4 hours/week for 6 months). This shows depth of commitment and allows you to build relationships and potentially gain a strong letter of recommendation.

<Aside>Volunteering in one location for longer is more valuable than brief stints at many.</Aside>

### Combine Activities with Purpose

Target experiences that match your strengths or fill gaps in your profile. For example:

| Gap                   | Suggested Experience                         |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Limited U.S. exposure | Volunteer in clinics, startups, or schools   |
| Limited hand skills   | Dental tech or lab experience                |
| No connections        | Network with students and join dental events |
| Limited leadership    | Lead student clubs or run online projects    |
