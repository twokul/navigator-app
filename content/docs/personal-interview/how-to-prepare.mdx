title: How to Prepare for Dental School Interviews
---

Once you know the type of interview you'll be facing, focus on structured
preparation.

### Build an Interview Question Bank

- Review **common interview questions** from [SDN's Interview Feedback
  forum](https://www.studentdoctor.net/schools/schools/3/).
- Write **structured responses** for different question types.
- Add personal stories to make your answers unique and **memorable**.

### What Interviewers Look For

- Schools evaluate your English **communication skills, professionalism, ethical
  reasoning, and motivation for dentistry**.
- Your responses should **demonstrate growth, adaptability, and a passion for
  the profession**.

### Rehearse Your Answers Out Loud

- Practice with a **mentor, friend, or recording** to improve fluency and
  confidence.
- Simulate **timed scenarios** for MMI-style interviews.
- Rehearse your answers until you memorize them well but still sound very
  naturally, not as a robot.

### Common Interview Questions & How to Answer Them

Here are some of the most frequently asked interview questions along with
effective response frameworks:

#### Tell me about yourself - the most common question!

- Keep it **chronological and relevant**.
- Cover your **background, education, clinical experience, and why you’re here today**.
- Prepare a cohesive and well structured story for 2-3 minutes.

#### Why our school?

- Research **each school's curriculum, values, and special programs**.
- Mention specific aspects like **clinical exposure, research opportunities, or
  community service initiatives**.

#### What are your weaknesses?

- Choose a **real weakness** (e.g., public speaking, delegation) and show how
  you're actively improving it. Never say you don't have any.

#### What sets you apart from other applicants?

- Highlight **unique qualities** like leadership, resilience, entrepreneurship,
  or adaptability.

#### Tell me about your shadowing/volunteering (or any other) experience.

- Explain **what you observed, what you learned, and how it reinforced your
  interest in dentistry**.
- Know well your application and all the experiences you had to be able to
  describe them well. Including personal stories and examples or anecdotes showing
  how you improved or what positive lesson you learnt would make your response
  even stronger.

#### Tell me about the biggest challenge you overcame lately and how?

- Be prepared to describe it and highlight along your story your positive
  qualities.

#### Ethical Scenarios (MMI Format)

- **Example:** "You see a classmate cheating during an exam. What do you do?"
- Use **ethical principles** like **autonomy, beneficence, non-maleficence, and
  justice** to justify your answer. They are covered in [ADA Code Of Ethics](/files/ada-code-of-ethics.pdf)
- Schools very often ask about ethical principals in different ways. They can
  ask you to share your experience when you had an **ethical dilemma** in your
  practice.

This video helped me prepare for ethical principles and questions about them:

Overall you can control the flow of your interview by sharing certain
experiences that will spark the interviewer's interest to ask more questions
about them. So depending on your response you can direct your interviewer one
way or another.

### Crucial part of the interview: Do you have any questions for me?

Prepare 7–10 insightful and school specific questions to show genuine interest
in the program. Research the school’s curriculum, research opportunities, and
community outreach through its website, YouTube, ask alumni and current students
to share some insights. Avoid asking easily searchable or negative questions;
instead, focus on topics that spark meaningful dialogue. Some examples:

- What kind of mentorship or academic support is available for students?
- What research opportunities are available for students, and how can they get
  involved?
- How does the school incorporate new dental technologies and techniques into
  its curriculum?
- Do students have opportunities to place implants during their clinical
  training?
- Aside from Give Kids a Smile Day and Project Homeless Connect, what other
  community outreach programs are available?

Be yourself. You've made it this far because they saw your potential on paper,
and everything you've accomplished has led you to this opportunity. Be real,
honest, and open—trust that you deserve to be here. Show confidence in your fit
for the program and your enthusiasm to be part of it.
