To work as a dentist in the US, you need a license. Each of the 50 states in the
USA has its own governing or regulatory body in the field of dentistry, called
the dental board. This board issues the license for professional practice. Just
google 'dental board' and the state abbreviation, and you'll land on their
website, where there's usually detailed information on how to get that coveted
license at a desired state.
