title: U.S. Visa Guide for International Dental Students
description: Step-by-step overview of F-1 visa and immigration requirements for internationally trained dentists applying to U.S. dental schools
---

When I applied to dental schools in the U.S., I was already living here with legal immigration status. Later, when I received my green card, everything became much simpler â€” no visa paperwork, no timeline stress.  
But for most international dentists applying to **Advanced Standing Programs (ASPs)**, navigating the **student visa process** is a major and sometimes overwhelming step.

If youâ€™re currently abroad or in the U.S. on a temporary visa, hereâ€™s what typically happens **after your dental school acceptance**.

---

### **Step 1: Receive Visa Instructions from Your School**

Once admitted, your school will email **detailed, step-by-step instructions** for requesting your **Form I-20**, which is required for your F-1 visa application.

Many universities use online systems for this. For instance, **USC uses the Trojan International (TI) portal**, where students upload personal details, financial proof, and passport copies to start the I-20 process.

---

### **Step 2: Follow the Schoolâ€™s Checklist Carefully**

Your schoolâ€™s email will include a checklist of required documents and instructions.  
Itâ€™s crucial to follow every detail precisely â€” even small errors (like choosing the wrong degree level or uploading an incorrect file type) can delay your I-20.

<Aside>
  ðŸ’¡ **Tip:** Read everything twice. I-20s are often processed in batches, so a small mistake can
  delay your file by weeks.
</Aside>

### **Step 3: Prepare Financial Documents**

Before issuing your I-20, the school must verify that you can afford the program.  
Each institution sets its own minimum funding requirement â€” for example, **USCâ€™s 2025 estimate is $83,445 per year**.

**Acceptable proof of funds includes:**

- Personal or family **bank statements**
- **Sponsor letters** from relatives or organizations
- **Bank solvency certificates**
- **Educational loan approval letters** (apply close to your visa appointment, since letters can expire in 30â€“60 days)

---

### **Step 4: SEVIS & I-20 Transfer (If Youâ€™re Already in the U.S.)**

If youâ€™re studying in the U.S. under an **F-1 visa**, youâ€™ll need to **transfer your SEVIS record** before your new school can issue a new I-20.

- The transfer must be completed **at least 15 days before classes start**, per SEVIS rules.
- Your **current school** must release your record to the new institution.
- Youâ€™ll also submit a **transfer request** through the new schoolâ€™s portal.

---

### **Step 5: Changing Visa Status (e.g., from H-4 to F-1)**

If youâ€™re in the U.S. under another visa category (like **H-4**, for dependents), most schools will connect you with their **Office of International Services (OIS)** to guide you through the **change-of-status** process.

At **USC**, for example, the OIS offers drop-in advising and detailed guidance for visa transitions.

---

### **Step 6: I-20 Processing Timeline**

Once all documents are correctly uploaded, schools typically issue your I-20 within **5â€“7 business days**.  
Most now deliver it **electronically** via secure portals or shared drives â€” so check your email regularly.

---

### **Step 7: Example â€” USCâ€™s Visa Process**

To give you a real example:

- USC begins issuing I-20s for the summer term in **mid-January**.
- Students must log into the **Trojan International portal** early to avoid delays.
- For those using **private loans**, USC advises waiting until **April** to apply since approval letters expire quickly.

All steps â€” including **SEVIS transfers** and **status changes** â€” are managed through the TI portal.

---

### **Step 8: Visa Status Diversity at USCâ€™s ASP**

At USCâ€™s Advanced Standing Program, students represent a **variety of immigration statuses**:

- **F-1 visa holders**
- Those already in the U.S. under **other visa categories** (like H-4)
- **Green card holders**
- Students who **recently changed** their status before starting the program

This diversity is common â€” and well-supported by university international offices.

### **Final Thoughts: Stay Organized and Proactive**

Every dental school has its own procedures, but they all provide the resources you need â€” if you follow instructions and stay ahead of deadlines.

If youâ€™re applying as an international student:

- Donâ€™t rush **loan applications** â€” timing matters.
- Track **SEVIS deadlines** carefully, especially when transferring schools.
- Reach out early to your **Designated School Official (DSO)** or OIS advisor for help.

It may feel complex at first, but with attention to detail and patience, itâ€™s
entirely manageable. Remember: **thousands of international students complete
this process successfully every year â€” and you can too.**
