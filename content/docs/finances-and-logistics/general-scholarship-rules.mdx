description: Scholarships and Funding Opportunities
---

When I first started looking into **Advanced Standing Programs (ASP) in the
U.S.**, I was both **excited and overwhelmed**. The opportunities were
incredible, but the price tags? **Terrifying.** Tuition alone could be anywhere
between **$100,000 to $400,000**, and that didn't even include living expenses,
exam fees, and everything else that comes with moving to a new country for
education.

As an **international dentist**, I quickly realized that funding options for ASP
students were **limited** compared to what’s available for traditional DDS/DMD
students. But that doesn't mean there are **no options**—it just means you have
to be strategic and persistent in **finding financial aid, scholarships, and
alternative ways to fund your education**.

## Are There Scholarships for Foreign-Trained Dentists in ASPs?

Unlike traditional DDS/DMD students, ASP applicants have fewer scholarship
options, as most U.S. dental schools prioritize financial aid for domestic
students. However, some programs do offer limited funding opportunities based on
merit, financial need, or specific institutional partnerships.

## What to Expect When Applying for Financial Aid?

- **Highly Competitive:** Limited funding means that scholarships and aid are
  highly competitive, often awarded to top-tier applicants with strong clinical
  backgrounds, research experience, and leadership roles.
- **Partial, Not Full Coverage:** Most scholarships do not cover full tuition;
  they may only provide **partial tuition waivers or stipends**.
- **Preference for U.S. Residents or Citizens:** Many schools prioritize U.S.
  applicants for institutional aid, but some programs allow international students
  to apply.
- **Deadlines & Applications:** Scholarship applications often have separate
  deadlines and requirements, so careful planning is essential.

## Schools That Offer Scholarships or Financial Aid to ASP Students

While most **top-tier programs** do not provide direct scholarships to ASP
students, some **Target and Safety Schools** may offer limited financial
support.

<Aside>
  If you're applying to any of the schools and you highly rely on financial aid, **email their
  financial aid office early**! Ask if they have **institutional aid for ASP students**, or if they
  can connect you with **external funding sources**. This will help you better prepare financially
  during your research stage, before even applying to schools.
</Aside>

## External Scholarships & Grants for ASP Applicants

Beyond universities, I found some **dental organizations and foundations** that
offer financial aid to foreign-trained dentists.

### Private Foundations & Organizations:

- **ADEA (American Dental Education Association) Scholarships** – Some
  scholarships are open to international students pursuing advanced education in
  dentistry.
- **The International College of Dentists (ICD) Global Scholarships** –
  Financial aid for non-U.S. dentists furthering their education in the U.S.
- **American Association for Dental Research (AADR) Fellowships** –
  Research-focused grants that may support ASP students involved in dental
  research.
- **The Pierre Fauchard Academy Scholarships** – Financial support for students
  demonstrating excellence in dentistry.

### Loan Options for International Students without US Green Card or Citizenship:

- **Prodigy Finance** – Offers student loans for international students pursuing
  graduate-level healthcare degrees in the U.S.
- **MPower Financing** – Provides educational loans without requiring a U.S.
  co-signer.
- If you are an international student with Green Card or US citizenship your
  best choice for loans and financial aid will be through the dental school you
  get accepted to. They usually give the best interest rates and support. Schools
  financial offices offer advisors who will instruct and guide you in your
  specific financial situation.

<Aside>
  Check the **FAFSA eligibility** for your school—even though most international students are **not
  eligible** (only US citizens and green-card holders are), some institutions may allow applications
  for **institutional aid**. **Start looking for scholarships early**! Some of these have deadlines
  **6–12 months before the program starts**, so it's worth keeping track of dates.
</Aside>

## Eligibility Requirements for Scholarships

### Common Criteria for ASP Scholarships:

- **Strong Academic Performance** – High **GPA, TOEFL and Exam** scores.
- **Proven Clinical & Research Experience** – A history of **dental practice,
  externships, and research contributions**.
- **Leadership & Community Service** – Demonstrated involvement in **dental
  outreach programs, volunteer work, or leadership roles**.
- **Financial Need** – Some scholarships consider **financial background and
  hardship**.
- **Commitment to Dentistry in Underserved Communities** – Some funding sources
  prioritize applicants committed to **serving underprivileged populations**.

<Aside>
  Highlight **your leadership, clinical experience, and research work** in your application essays
  and recommendation letters to increase your chances of receiving funding.
</Aside>

## How to Increase Your Chances of Securing Financial Aid?

- **Apply to Schools Offering Assistantships** – Research-focused schools often
  offer **RA/TA positions** that provide funding.
- **Look for External Scholarships Early** – Many grants and scholarships have
  **early deadlines (6–12 months before enrollment)**.
- **Consider Lower-Cost Schools** – Schools with lower tuition and a lower cost
  of living can significantly reduce financial burden.
- **Reach Out to Alumni & Networks** – Networking with former ASP students can
  provide insights on **funding strategies**.
- **Work with a Financial Advisor** – Some dental financial aid advisors
  specialize in helping international students navigate funding options.

## Conclusion

an Advanced Standing Program in the U.S. are limited, they **do exist**. To
increase your chances of receiving funding, strategically **select schools with
available scholarships, apply for external grants, consider
research/assistantship roles, and explore private loan options**. With careful
planning and a strong application, you can find ways to make your **U.S. dental
education more affordable**.
