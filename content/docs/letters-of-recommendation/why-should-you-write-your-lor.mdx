title: Why Should You Write Your Recommendation Letters?
description: Learn which recommenders strengthen your dental school application and how each can highlight your unique strengths
---

Every dental school has its own **requirements for recommendation letters**, so
always check each program’s specific policies. Most schools typically ask for
letters from a **Dean**, a **Professor**, and a **Dentist** you’ve worked or
shadowed with. In general, choose recommenders who can speak credibly about your
**academic performance**, **clinical competence**, **professionalism**, and
**personal qualities**.

Here are the best types of recommenders and what they can highlight:

1. **A Dentist You Have Shadowed or Worked With**
   - Describes your **hands-on experience**, **work ethic**, and ability to thrive in a professional dental environment.
   - Ideal for showcasing your **responsibility, patience, and interpersonal skills** when interacting with patients.

2. **Science Professors (Biology, Chemistry, Anatomy, etc.)**
   - Can attest to your **academic strengths**, **critical thinking**, and **problem-solving abilities**.
   - If you’ve done research, a **research advisor or lab supervisor** can highlight your **scientific curiosity and research skills**.

3. **Employers or Supervisors from Healthcare or Volunteer Work**
   - If you’ve worked in a **clinical or community health setting** (such as a nursing home or public health clinic), they can speak to your **dedication to patient care** and **commitment to service**.
   - Even non-healthcare supervisors can emphasize your **professionalism, reliability, and teamwork.**

4. **Mentors or Supervisors from Extracurricular and Leadership Roles**
   - If you’ve led an organization, volunteered extensively, or contributed to student initiatives, these recommenders can spotlight your **leadership, initiative, and collaborative spirit**.

**Tip:** Choose recommenders who know you well enough to provide specific,
personalized examples—not just generic praise. Strong letters tell stories that
prove your readiness for dental school.
