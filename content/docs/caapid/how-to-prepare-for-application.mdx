title: How to prepare for the CAAPID application
---

Foreign-trained dentists often delay starting the application process, not
realizing how lengthy it is. Processing the primary application can take 4-6
weeks before it even reaches the dental school. Some schools also require a
secondary application, which must be completed before the primary application is
reviewed, adding another 2-6 weeks of processing. Dental schools begin offering
interviews to early applicants first, giving them a significant advantage.

I strongly recommend **starting preparations well before the CAAPID cycle
opens** in early March. While you cannot submit your application before then,
you can and should prepare your documents in advance. This allows you to **upload
and submit everything quickly**, increasing your chances of getting noticed by
schools early in the cycle.

### Key Preparation Steps Before March

- **Letters of Recommendation (LORs)** – Start requesting them **several months in advance**, as recommenders need time to write and submit them.
- **Personal Statement** – Expect multiple revisions; my own statement went through **20 drafts** before I finalized it.
- **Transcripts/ ECE Evaluation** – Since these take weeks to process, request them as soon as possible.
- **INBDE & TOEFL Score Submission** – Make sure your scores are ready and sent directly to CAAPID.

By preparing ahead of time, you can **submit early**, increasing your chances of
securing an **interview invitation** and moving forward in the selection
process.

### Use Application Binder

An application binder keeps all relevant information and documents organized for
easy reference throughout the application process:

- Recent transcript
- Scores of the exams (make sure they are up to date and handy). [How to submit them to CAAPID](https://help.liaisonedu.com/ADEA_CAAPID_Applicant_Help_Center/Sending_Your_Official_Transcripts%2C_Foreign_Evaluations%2C_and_Test_Scores_to_ADEA_CAAPID/Sending_Official_Test_Scores_to_ADEA_CAAPID)

- Updated CV/resume (PDF file). [Here is the example](/files/idds-cv-template.pdf) of the CV in PDF from
  University of Washington that I used as a template for my CV and it worked well.
  So you can use it to compile your CV.

  Once your application is submitted, you cannot re-upload, update, or edit the documents in any
  way; however, you can upload new documents, experiences, etc.
