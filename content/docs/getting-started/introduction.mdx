## Welcome

Hello, future US dentists! 👋

I know how **frustrating** the application process for US dental schools is. I
went through it myself! There is so much information available online. It takes
a long time and effort to aggregate it in one place. That's precisely what I
have done: summarised all the useful information and broke it down into clear
steps to **save your time** and energy. 😁

## About The Author

My name is Anna Papian and I'm a foreign-trained dentist from Saint Petersburg,
Russia. Just a few years ago, I had no idea how the U.S. dental licensing
system worked. I moved here with a dream and no roadmap — and I had to figure
everything out from scratch.

Despite the odds, I got accepted into **three top Advanced Standing Programs**
in my very first application cycle:

📍 **USC, NYU, and Rutgers** — and was **waitlisted at Loma Linda University**.

My journey wasn’t easy. I studied hard, worked long hours, and stayed focused —
and I believe you can do the same.

Here’s a quick snapshot of what helped me stand out:

- ✅ **Strategic approach** to choosing only 7 dental programs to apply to instead of 24
- ✅ **TOEFL scores**: 107 and 105
- ✅ **Passed INBDE on the first and only attempt**
- ✅ **GPA: 3.5 (U.S. converted)**
- ✅ 6 years of **clinical practice and a year of teaching experience** in my home country
- ✅ U.S. **registered dental assistant (RDA) license** and hands-on experience working in U.S. clinics
- ✅ Led **hands-on workshops** and presented at **dental events and online educational platforms in the U.S.**
- ✅ Took on a **leadership role at a U.S.-based dental startup** focused on AI-driven surgical innovation and education
- ✅ **Submitted my CAAPID application early** (March)
- ✅ Strong **bench test skills**

Throughout the process, I've helped other international dentists refine their
personal statements, choose the right schools, and build their unique narrative.

Now, I create step-by-step resources and content to support dentists like you
through this process — on **YouTube, Instagram**, and through this guide.
